Get writing bitched
Great job dickhead
Bitxhes
We need a description don't we
We do
Can you write one based on the title of the chat?
I'll see what I can do
How long/short does it need to be
I have no idea how many characters but I think it was like 1024
Ok
That's just
No
My story is nearly finished
It's too long for the topic
So I need to fix that
But I'm really proud of it
I need to shave off about 300 characters
That's like 60 words
Ok that's doable
Probably
It might be 1024 words
Yeah it is I checked
This is gonna be hard
I mean words as opposed to characters
Oh i missed that
No it's definitely chars
I have it
It is ready
What do I do
<@278270733589807114>
Fuck off im working
What do i do tom
Want me to just paste it in here?
Wait 50 minutes
Ok
Druggie
Cunt
Dude...
Bro?
has it been 50 mins yet
Omf just put it in the chat
Pedro and I had completed roughly two thirds of our 5k+ mile trek along the US-Canadian border, so we were getting rather peckish. Luckily, I planned for this. I unmounted Pedro and removed two apples from his undercarriage.
Pedro was overwhelmed with emotion at the sight of the two apples. In fact, if he weren't an American mammoth donkey, he would be jumping up and down like Peppa Pig on a muddy trampoline.
Before we could gormandise, there was a noise behind us about 300 miles ahead. Looking through my 1x50 binos, I could clearly see a blurry figure in the distance, but that's all I could spot.
Upon removing my face from the binoculars, I noticed that Pedro had fallen down a large concealed hole in the ground. I regret, I only knew of this as I had also fallen down the hole.
Luckily, my rent-a-donkey's corpse protected me from the spikes at the bottom, saving my life. A deep voice, capable of speaking in block capitals, bellowed, "I AM BIGFOOT; I WILL EAT YOUR DONKEY, AND THEN I WILL ANALLY RAPE YOU".
motherfucker replies to all comments trolling them
What the fuck is this?
this woman
is a fucking witch
Wow that's some good parenting
Solid parenting
Doesn't contradict all reputable psychology
It's a mother's instinct and that's why her children will be perfect
what's wrong with my story
it got a bit concise towards the end because of character restraints
Yeah there were a few twists
I guess it's not what I would expect myself to write
did you like the 1x50 binoculars
because
the first number
is the magnification
i like the noise behind them being 300 miles ahead
thanks
it was a lot of effort
as soon as you own a game it's removed from your wishlist
oh ha
i didn't mean that kind of ordering
oh
I have
order as in 1, 2, 3 etc
but I still want them all
ok cool
Hey Tom any news on that back door job?
Still going
Alicia tells me that your 'interview technique' did you no favours
Wtf
Maybe my lack thereof
What does that even mean?
Perhaps
But Simon and Richard should be back doing interviews now
haven't we already established that alicia's a cunt
Not only are they better suited and more lenient, but they also know how desperate we are
And yes
Alicia is a shit
I really thought I was being properly genuine, and that we almost had something of a rapport
Like
Fucking women
Hah
that'd go down well
Don't be yourself
And I told you ken are superior
MEN
Fucking Ken
So do i just like reapply?
Yeah if you do I'll tell my fucking dude Richard
Cool
Hopefully he'll just push it along but that's no guarantee
Gotcha
😉
Just spoken to simon
Told him I'd give him your number
oh, ok
well you have my number
Is that dope?
yeah that's cool
gave my number to a barman once
Yeah but what is your number?
Oh dude
Gross
he never rang
07443852543 i think
it should be on your phone
what's the difference between backdoor and warehouse?
i imagine warehouse is working between the warehouse and the shelves and then backdoor is receiving deliveries into the warehouse
thats a guess
waiting for tim to tell me how wrong i am
hahahaha
MNEK
he's like aahhh MNEK bitch stop fuckin hangin on MNEK
What a shitty artist
get off MNEK
Backdoor is the warehouse
So you take deliveries, do split down and do dollies
And sometimes help out on the shop floor
so what's warehouse
Plus waste and reductions
Warehouse is that
That's warehouse
what
Unless you mean in an actual warehouse rather than a store warehouse
Don't go for that it's bad
have you worked in one
reddit api giving me some sass
my laptop's keyboard is being bipolar
All keyboards are bipolar
The keys are either pressed or not
it stopped working entirely
it did the same thing yesterday
but it was working earlier today
I mean you know what I'm going to say don't you
can you try and be more useful
It's gone twenty five to one
indeed
I'm not obliged to be useful past 17:30
Unless you pay me
i never am
What are the house prices like in canada
unsurprising?
Can you try and be more useful
i can
Oh you bastard
How can I become more emotive
I feel like a robot
Like

You could lie
Also my laptop is now entirely frozen
With no foreseeable recovery without killing it
My "tangle free" but warping earphones make me want to kill myself

"Q: Is the lens adjustable or do I have to move the whole projector to change the picture size?"
"A: For now, you will need to move the projector to adjust the picture size"
What the fuck
*for now*
As if they can roll that function out in a fucking software update
To a projector
Are they regarded?
They must be because that's not even an Amazon question
Surely you can just change the keystone
It's in their FAQ
Oh wow
Why are you looking at bad projectors?
Someone needs one and its my job to find a simultaneously cheap and good one
Woah this one supports Chormecast!
I submitted a support ticket to a different company and now both our automatic email systems are talking to each other and I can't stop it
I told you that AI would be our downfall
I have begun to feel the air in my beard as I walk
Just thought you'd like to know
Jamuel you have no beard
You're fooling no one
I'd send you a pic but I'm actually not very proud of my beard
And I don't do that shit
I risk making myself look human
Yeah alright I get the picture
Can we change the chat icon to that
Oh yes
It's that day again where you scroll through reddit and wonder why everyone's talking about 9/11
That's the end of that story?
Shut up your nickname is bad
Says Walt Disney's autistic cat

It's been one day

imagine someone saying "but what if it starts at 9 instead of 9:30?" but in a whiny grovelling voice like it's the end of the world which, by the way, revolves around them

Okay then
Almost accidentally drank a can of compressed air
Yeah mOtHeRfUcKeRs
Wo
Up to date on my daily sudokus finally
Oh man if only you could invest in crypto in reverse time
I've lost 50%
Yeah let's circle back around to the can of compressed air
Do we have to
I'd rather not
I'm just trying to work out some logistics
Do you have any questions?
I suppose I do
Like how do you accidently drink a can of compressed air?
You know when you have a drink
You don't exactly need to look right at it to pick it up and drink it
Well I picked up the compressed air instead of my water
Anything else?
Why the FUCK am I purple?
Id really like to see what your brain looks like on the inside
Me too
Aren't you going to ask me the main question?
The obvious one?
The question you've been missing this whole time?
U gei boy?
Who's the old woman that only Wilf can see in the end of time episode?
Shiva
God
She hulk
Am I getting warmer?
i think it's implied that she's the doctor's mother
but it's deliberately left open
i'm very disturbed by the colour of my name
So we serious about going bowling again then?
im up for that
any time
preferably a week day with about a week's notice
then i have an excuse to take a day off this boring job
i mean i would anyway
but it's not like i'd have something to do instead otherwise
I have the utmost faith in Tom to designate a suitable date
hah
https://giphy.com/gifs/mrw-week-everyone-bmQLgRV0aXiOk
I don't work at tesco as of this sunday
not transferring then?
Still 'under review'
like a windowsill?
that works better out loud
It's a shame because they only just updated our music and it's frickin sick
they probably just changed the radio station
they dont play the radio you choff
its probably just a pop spotify playlist
is it crappy kfc royalty free
can you get royalty free fried chicken?
we should set up a royalty free food site
Hey Jamie, got an idea for the bot
shoot
lyrics
we're on the same wavelength man
unfortunately i can't find any good APIs that don't cost money
well that sucks
what's an API again?
there's one for getting lyrics from a song title/artist
but not the other way round
application programming interface
basically a way to interact with a website/service through code
what it does with urban dictionary, wordnik for word of the day etc
and obviously discord
yeah ok
how'd you get the others?
publicly available
generally you kind of search "website name" + API
convenient
when there is one
you have to cross your fingers
basically all it is is opening a link like this
http://api.urbandictionary.com/v0/define?term=bacon
and then going through all that garbage and formatting it nicely
alright cool
could you make one?
need a big database
idk
it's one of the things i'm looking into
fair enough
I know *I* couldn't
i wouldn't mind making something that could access AZLyrics
since that seems a simple enough webpage
yeah that's what I was thinking
it's just text right
yeah think so
https://giphy.com/gifs/sigh-aVZeSJpQ0r42c
fucking tesco
what have they done now
crrashed my browser
uh
during an application
probably not tesco's fault
yeah you would say that
Well I think it's your laptop
Since you asked
yeah actually that's pretty fair
Unlike your laptop
indeed
found a better toy to stick in the gap though
much more efficient
Have you been on bad Dragon again
Why is Dragon capitalised
what?
oh
no it's a Go-Go
Ohh shit I used to collect those
yeah man
I still got like 20
I had boxes of them
Tupperware not cardboard
Sold them all on ebay
Made a wholly insignificant amount
yeah why bother
this way I get to look at them when we sell this house in a decades time
and suffer terrible nostalgia
before throwing them into a skip
and failing to move on with my life
Still
The best part of taking shit to the tip
Is reminding yourself that at least you don't work at the tip
wow
rood
I'm looking at a double LP and a poster rn
and the poster somehow costs more
What l.p. and poster
Wtf phone I didn't ask for dots
also apparently I made a 5 pound transaction
which I don't remember
I pre ordered the new muse album
I mean
I'm not going to listen to it on cd
But
Early access to concert tickets
col
not fixing that
Col in ded
hah
TLoZ:OoT Double LP, and a Hyper Light Drifter gliclee poster
both pretty awesome
Oh
Snap!
Should've asked me
I've got those coming out my ears
yeah I'll fucking bet
not like they're exclusive from one online store based in america
california to be precise
Well maybe they could think of a catcher name
Fucking catcher
you wanna know the name?
No I just asked what l.p. and poster because it's one of my nervous ticks
fair enough
I'm glad we cleared that up
oooooh
it was Lei Wulong
it all makes sense now
Couldn't be clearer
still got like £69 of pending transactions that haven't come out of my account yet
but what's another 65 amirite
£134
hooeee
I need a *job* my man
Have you been to the *job* shop?
no, I'm too busy sticking it to the *man*
Sticking *what* to the *man*?
A *tail*?
fucking dick
Semantics
nvm the shipping is $57 without insurance
I'll just fucking check ebay
Woooahhh
I meam
Wohhhh
ikr
£191
the previous 67 isn't in the same order
it was from sainsburys earlier
Yah but it hasn't gone out yet
57
and yeah I guess so
And it was 69
what's $40 in £?
Are you asking me in 2014 or now?
now
google is accurate asshole
!convert $40 £
Damn
Worth a try
Good idea
yeah
Probably like £35
Oop
£36
Oh it's £37 now
£38?!
Quick before it oh it's £39 now
well that's bullshit
it's probably like 30
£30.66
Wow
nvm, just bought the record for £37.70
The markets have calmed down
beats 60 bucks postage
Didn't see that coming
yeah well we're still getting germany
besides
we're not even out yet
Yeah no the economy will pretend to shot itself again in march
Shit
Shat
Shut
yeah probably
Shat?
Shet? *
My phone won't let me be whimsical
no one bought me the fucking posters I wanted
I didn't know you wanted a poster
I want like 3
People and birthdays
but 1 of them has 60 buck postage
so I guess I only want 2
I already have 3 from the same artist
meh
I only want one
wanna see it?
Sure
obviously without the frame
That's pretty cool
it's a lot cheaper than the american one too
What is it
Shadow of the Colossus
by Sparkly Crow
Is that an internet
uh
it's a playstation game
from back on the PS2
they ported it for PS3
Huh yeah it did ring a bell
and they recently remade it for PS4, like an actual remastering
which I haven't bought yet
after all I've played the game like 3 times already
it'll probably be like £6 in a sale at some point
then I'll get it
but I have a lot of games to play
I want the ok computer tshirt
8 plus pc games
It's constantly sold out
wow
that's pretty impressive
Might be because they're on tour
can't you do that thing where they e-mail you when it's back in stock
I asked them for that, apparently "they can't do it for that specific product"
wtf
Which is literally bullshit
yeah
it's like an automated thing
maybe it would crash the system
but that seems unlikely
I'm not bragging but I could probably write a thing that tells me when it's in stock
Actually is that bragging
Is that a humble brag
idk dude
I believe you
that's the main thing
I don't want to be a humble bragger
what's the t shirt look like
That's worse than a bragger who doesn't care
It's white with the ok computer art on the front
remind me again what that is?
Radiohead album
duh
The one with the aeroplane
the fucking cover
And the black and blue cross
I don't see an aeroplane
Ah yeah
See
I don't know why i focused on the aeroplane
It's the nose of the aeroplane below the cross
wow
I thought it was a shoe
Nah I think there's other art
well I can't find that tshirt, but there are other good ones
Yeah I had a look
Not a fan of fake merch tho
I guess
but at the same time
you get a t-shirt out of it
I could go to a printer and get a white ok computer shirt printed whenever I want
Takes the fun out of kt
It
dude then you could sell it
actually that's illegal
but why is it in white anyway?
Yeah and then I could get sued!
Because it blends with the album art
Ohohohoh
That is good
told you so
you can change the colour too
and the product
get it on a fucking hoodie if you wanted
or a scarf, weirdly
That music video has tits in it
it does indeed
although they are hardly comforting
Yeah there's a guy with an axe as well
cuts all his own limbs off
I love that song
it's up there
ANYWAY TROUBLE IS TSHIRTS AND HOODIES ONLY WORK FOR HALF THE YEAR
Wohhhh
Sorry for shouting
dude I wear tshirts all year
I have like 30
I wash them half at a time
and just wear them for a fortnight
I only have 7 pairs of trousers though
maybe
Trousers don't need to be swapped as often I find
I guess
I do dirty my trousers easily though
I'm not ashamed
I like to keep my hands clean
Not gonna read into that
hahah
I like how many levels it works on
!define inception
nvm
Not gonna read over that
yeah don't
not worth
I was gonna look something up
what was it Jamie?
can't decide which type of porn to say?
Those classic doctor who monsters that look like penises sticking out of green vaginas
right
gonna say no to that
pretty sure it was clothing related
but Im too far gone now
great
thanks so much
Hey I didn't get any warning when I saw this
dude it's doctor who
at least it was wholesome
Do you think their genitals look like human heads
their genitals don't exist
as fictional beings
unless you find me that rule34
then they don't exist
and even then
it's not necessarily canon
Doctor who has no canon
well then
oh I remember
You're welcome
there we go
yeah thanks I guess
not sure what exactly spurred that back
I 100% deliberately distracted you from thinking about it
Sometimes when you try to think of something your brain fucks up and intentionally suppresses it
huh
No idea why
That's toms job
amen
welp, my sister's birthday is over
Happy birthday molly
Not that she's here
yeah no she went to bed like an hour ago
Why does everyone have birthdays at the end of the year
well I can tell you why people have birthdays in september
Ahaehaehaehahererhehehehhehrhrh
as for later months
I guess people just like fucking in winter
Makes sense I guess
unless of course it's some sort of weird vicious cycle
What's giclee
look it up ignant
Ugh do I have to
Sorry for asking
indeed
as I was saying
if there happened to be a light increase in birthdays in a particular month or season
then it would stand to reason that after that generation grew up, there should be an increase in birthdays 9 months after theirs
rinse and repeat
this generation just happens to be a winter one
that being said
you and tom have earlier birthdays
so idfk
I think my parents were just aiming for Friday the 13th
For the lolz
As they said in the late 90s
that's like
a different month every year
pretty wide fucking target is all I'm saying
although it would have to be the 13th of the month
Oh shit I never finished my day of the week guesser
I need to make that again
And finish it
cool
well my internet duties have been fulfilled
Oh man
Is this it
!define giclee
So basically it's anything you print out with ink
high quality ink motherfucker
I have a laserjet so I guess it doesn't count
and high quality paper
and high quality images
it's a fucking poster
Why does everything have to sound like a chocolate
Just call it what it is
more like Gicgay amirite
You said it
alright I'm going to bed
have a nice night Jamie
Eh twa
Grassy ass
Assy grass
Dude
You get at me about reposts
That's my fucking Facebook pic
Ok it was
Don't blame me
I don't know what Facebook is
I've done something to my back
Isaac there's an apprenticeship open day in the training room right now
Yippee
I applied for that back door job
It's like 6 to 10 pm though
I bet you like a backdoor job
Pays better than yours
Hey nothing pays better than figuring out shit like why our website is down but only for us specifically in our office
The euphoria is immense
!markov
No I'm pretty sure the majority of entry level jobs pay better than that
My sister's boyfriend just got a job where he makes £100 for a little over 4 hours work
He's working 16 hour this week
Nice
Will he go full time
Also I'm seriously considering removing my left arm because my back hurts so much
Ohhh oowwwwwww
Do some stretches
That would make it 10x worse
I can't fucking move my arm
Go complain to someone employing you
Who supposedly care more
I'm falling apart
I-I-III-I-I'm fallin apart
I can't wait for wonderwall to play here again
My boss is currently shit talking all his employees from a few meters from me
Discussing all our flaws with Alicia
Ask them if they're gonna play it again
I double dare you motherfucker
They'll say, "perhaps"
What do you think it feels like to die
I think it feels like having slept funny and pulled a muscle in your upper left back
Can't wait for your funeral Cumtank
There will be many things at my funeral
But there won't be a Cumtank
I could do with a nice week off
Or five
We should go bowling
Yes
Any time you want to suggest a date
The 17th
Could it be a bit later in the week idk if I could get Monday off
Maybe like Wednesday or sutin
Omfg you prick
What
How about you suggest a date
Weekends are always good for me
Wouldn't mind a day off
We're doing wedges day
Oh fuck you
Weekdays are fine as long as I leave enough notice to get the day off
Oh did you mean to say wednesday
If so then I will ask for Wednesday off
That's if Isaac can make it too
19th, sounds good
Oh, it will be
Come be my backdoor boy isaac
Ok I've requested wednesday
Off
They'll let me know tomorrow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkFpNVxzhTs
haven't you already posted that exact image
I only just took it
spooky
time travel confirmed
Pretty sure you just see the same picture every time he posts a cage
have you seen the interview with the russian spies who poisoned that guy
they ask them why they were in salisbury
and one of them starts reciting from memory what is probably the first paragraph of the salisbury wikipedia page
Have you not seen that particular cage?
haven't you already posted that exact image
went a bit too far on the rounding down i think
🚔
What's this now
a fuckin cop car
doi
Who you calling a doi
cumtank
that's who
Don't be fucking dissing the name you came up with
it's a porn name jamie
you're about the least sexual person I can think of currently
Gee
Thanks
How can I be more sexual
idk
undo a button
grow a beard
itch your balls publicly
I haven't shaved in over a month
I'm almost at 2 centimetres
complain about the lack of morals that is sweeping our society
have more money
I don't actually buy anything
I have the monies
aren't you about to buy muse tickets
They haven't even announced the tour yet
on the other hand you could always say you were gay
instant predator
Sometimes I think people think I'm gay
I could see that
I'm really not
no I don't think you are
in fact I think you're too hetero
maybe that's the problem
Well
you need more flamboyancy
I like to think I can be a bit camp
but see camp isn't sexy
it's just camp
on the other hand
you're talking to me rn
so idk what tips you think you're gonna get
Good point
It's probably a good sign that you don't find me sensual
I guess so
Sexual
same thing
Same thing I guesss
Aaaaa
i think Tom's the most sexual of us 3
in every sense
then again I don't know how ander fairs
Tom's too sexual
yeah but only once you get to know him
it's like a dark side
except that's the light side
I think Anders probably the best example
of sexuality?
you sure you're not gay
Hey tom your brother is sexual
he'd just agree
Not gay
Just appreciative
same
I can tell a man is handsome
well
I like to think I can
But you don't want his cock in your asd
you don't scream handsome to me Jamie
sorry to say bud
Ohhh isaac
You're tearing me apart
https://giphy.com/gifs/theroom-the-room-tommy-wiseau-l0HU2QpFqukBfMLD2
I do try
I think a buzzcut would do it
What do you think
christ
hmm
Jamie with a buzzcut
no I think you need to be manlier to pull that off
I think it would make me manlier
If that's what I want
yeah like a child wearing a tank top
get a scar dude
that'd do it
Oh god
sandpaper your face
Childrens with tank tops are the worst childrens
yeah man
Do acne scars count
no dude
they make you less manly
wear tighter clothes
like
slightly too tight
knowhumsayin
That would just be physically uncomfortable
manliness isn't comfortable Jamie
why do you think men drink beer?
it isn't tasty
it's MANLY
I drink cider
Beer is disgusting
see
that right there
there's no big dick power in that sentence
doesn't matter about your actual dick size
just gotta pull it off
not literally
look dude I've never met a woman
so what are we even tallking about
Yeah what's the point
I'd be happy in a studio with a bed and a KFC next door for the rest of my life
good fucking lord
I'll keep that in mind
you can be sad and hopeful Jamie
doesn't take much to imagine a mansion with a KFC next door
One day I will write a song about a mansion with a KFC next door
It'll be an 11 minute electro prog rock masterpiece
gross
12 minute
meh
It'll start with a nice twiddly reverb keyboard bit and then BLAM an incredibly catchy distorted guitar riff
With a second guitar playing a twiddly riff over the first
i'll see it when i believe it
You can't see sound Isaac
you don't know
Yes I do
Sound goes in your ears
You ask someone without ears to say "yes" if they can see your words
what if I have synaesthesia
Then take a Nurofen
God this doctor who episode is dated
Except it came out last year
Bad models of fake dead person heads
a la Jaws
The French spin off
zee shark, ee iz too beeeg
I need to learn French if just for comedic effect
i feel like i know enough french
Quatre-vingt-dix-neuf
Fucking why
quatre-vingt if you know what I mean
👌
What?
Oh
No
That's
No
just say it slower
it's fine
quatre. vingt
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie
Hahahahhahahhahahahaha
Baked
oodelally
oodelally
golly what a day
How's yours been
pretty alright
played a lot of vidya
Spiderman game?
not today specifically, but yeah
played Overcooked and Hyrule Warriors today
made a pizza
watched some Preacher
drank some vodka and oj
now I'm eating pringles
What flavour
bbq
Hmm
dude I bet you like plain
Sweet chilli
Me in a nutshell
HAH
Alright bbq
a flavour taken from chinese cuisine
it's you all over
I'm eating BBq because it's vegan
these aren't technically my pringles
That
Are those two sentences related
yes
highly
What flavours aren't vegan
one might think they spring from the same cause
Salted must be vegan
sour cream and onion
Chili
salt and vinegar
Really?
yepp
That's not vegan?
correct
How
do you make pringles?
Potatos
And flavour
do you
make
PRINGLES
Oh not how
No

Might have to be Thursday
Or Friday
I'm asking my boss if he can cover but 8 looked at his calendar and looks like he's off site for half the day
So
Anyway I'm awaiting a response but probably gonna be Thursday
JESUS Jamie why don't you suggest a DATE
I haven't got anything back from my boss
Can't you do the weekend
I'm moving next weekend
Fuck man
Shit boy
still gonna ask for wednesday off when i get back on monday
i formally requested it yesterday so they better not give me "you didn't leave enough notice"
im annoyed with them that they didn't give it any thought today
too busy playing golf the lazy fucks
duuuude
what
What?
did you actually send that
I think it'll teach Jason not to send me unsolicited bullshit
if you say so
That might actually have been a mistake
yeah
No shit
Okay fucknuts how would you handle that situation
is there an opt-out
if not just ignore it
or politely ask for your email address to be removed
in case that person might have connections
you know
Okay first of all I'm a fucking alpha male
But secondly he's only the President, he doesn't have connections
oh well that's alright then
if he's only the President
President be fucked
probably
Dude just say nothing
I'll bring the whole system down after a year
Look it's not like it's personal, I'm sure he understands
I can't have been the only one
You're definitely the only one
yeah
That dudes not even gonna get responses from anyone else
Then in sure he'll be happy for the company
I don't see how you're only seeing the negatives in this
You told a random student charity worker "fuck you"
Haha
Just because he works for a students union doesn't make him a 'charity worker'
That's what he called himself
I'm just saying, do you tell flyer pushers to fuck themselves?
it's easier to do that
there's no digital record
I've just been told I'm not very nice
How do you feel
Empty
!define empty
lol tom did you get a reply then
Not yet homemeister
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK15hA_QcyI
Guys I want to come clean
I was too much of a pussy to hit send
Jason got the better of me
Yeah I figured
Thank you for saying so though
Is this progress?
Because I'm fine with lying
I just don't like being caught
So this doesn't feel like progress
Whatever dude
Wow you'd make a great therapist
Ain't no caught without lying in the first place
Ain't no fucking fun
fuck dude i completely missed that send button
i feel like a complete idiot now
not giving you the fucking phone numbers
dont trust tom enough
Lol I give you numbers
yeah and i dont do shit
you're you
This chat is shit anyway
😂
you're the kind of person who sends "fuck you" to a student union president
We established that that wasn't canonical
that roge guy is in wales
why the fuck is he on the chat you might ask
he lives in wales
Oh
I feel like I'm missing integral plot points here
my life is like a ___________________ movie
no plot points

hey you know
the people who started discord
would have been doing so in a world of teamspeak and  mumble and skype
we should create a new live chat
might replace discord
we could be rich
Maybe if we were any good at coding
well
Also how exactly does discord make money
good question
discord nitro is probably a big help
though i don't know how many people actually use that
I've seen a few
discord messaging isn't end-to-end encrypted
fun fact there
they probably sell our data
i found a list of all the ways they make money according to "feedough" dot com
apparently it's just nitro and merch
id love a discord merch

what did you vote for?
i havent voted in a general election yet
the last one was 2 months before my 18th
youre not doing your bit
i voted labour in a council election though
i cant wait for corbyn to destroy student loans so we can scrap affordable and accessible education for the poor by subsidising the policy by raising taxes for everyone, including the poor
goddamn im so fucking intelligent
mr fish finger though
umm

why is the bot still shoesring?
!markov

Chink
what the fuck dude
Inconsequential racial slurs help externalise the rage
yeah didn't hitler say that?
Not in English
I applied for that thing btw
I still doubt my likelihood of success
how long has it been?
Since I applied?
Like 2 days
Including today
oh well for me its been 3 weeks
Since applying to transfer?
yeah
Yikes
fucks sake
it would be legal if we married each other you know
and apparently fucking moral
I am aware
glad in fact
im sorry
are you now making a pass on me
is that whats happening?
I'm stating my happiness that gay marriage is legal
that is all
and if I were to make a pass on a guy
I'm sorry tom but you're not the hottest guy I know
excuse me?
name 10 guys hotter than me
I mean
ok
do you really want me to do this
dont fuck me about
Ryan Gosling
Chris Hemsworth
Ewan McGregor
Joel Walker
jesus dude okay im sorry

I gotta keep going
Bradley Cooper
Jake Gyllenhaal
okay ive fucking had it now
Orlando Bloom
Ryan Reynolds
Tom Hardy
you want to know why there are terrorists and school shooters isaac? Its because you wont fuck me
I guess you learn something new everyday
Chris Pratt
see ive only heard of some of these people
and of these people i havent heard of them very often
Joseph Gordon Levitt also but that's 11 so no worries
not as often as i hear of me
besides, its pretty gay rating men you want to fuck
it's pretty gay to ask someone to name 10 men they'd rather fuck than you
but I've got the balls to be that someone Tom
have you?
ive got the balls to fuck you, if only as a meme
you'd fuck me as a meme?
I'm not sure Ive ever been this insulted
well im sorry but im not fucking you for anything less than a meme or a grand
a grand?
dude I have like
17 of those
dont know what youre complaining for then
I'm just trying to figure out how much I'd fuck you for
but I'm reasonably sure it's more than a grand
so we're all good
how about if i had a knife
are you asking if i would rather die or suffer grave mutilation, than fuck you for free?
thats not for free isaac
i get to unload my love sac inside you and you get to keep your insides
fairtrade
hmm
I'm honestly unsure
I didn't know I had this much pride
well goddamn perhaps ive uncovered a new technique for therapy
ask them if they would fuck you if you had a knife?
Therapist
I think you're the one that would need the therapist
The rapist
ffs
Therapy told me I'm gay so i think I've got it covered
I'm going to sleep now, having lived yet another day without having penetrating you in anyway
sweet dreams
!define sweet dreams
do people really say 56
depends on what they're trying to say
if they're trying to say 56
then yes
well apparently they're trying to say sweet dreams
that seems entirely inefficient
well i mean if the other person knows what you mean
then it's literally more efficient
all you're saying there is 5 6
that could mean anything
cunty douche
!define 56
that's
incredibly odd and specific
"Yamamoto ended up hitting a tree while traveling 300mph. This proved fatal."
unlucky
yeah man

coulda happened to anyone
makes you think
imagine if that had been me
maybe you would have thought to dodge the tree
maybe
*maybe*
I got a new mouse for my birthday
it's got slightly too little space for my final two fingers
i've been rocking a logitech g502 for the past couple years
best mouse i've had
you say that like I know exactly what that mouse is
well it's a pretty popular model
but anyway
we live in a time where you can press letter-buttons on a piece of plastic and have a screen turn into an encyclopaedia that shows you specific references to the data that you created by pressing the aforementioned letter-buttons
that is true
have done for a little while now
my mouse is getting a little old
it still works ok but i should be on the lookout for a replacement for when the day comes that it starts tracking actual mouse movements of the rodent population in portugal instead of my very precise and impatient wrist jerks
I just hope this one's paint doesn't rub off
made my last mouse look like a leper
the grips on my mouse are awful
it's like
you know when you were 7
and you painted a piece of paper with wet teabags to make it look like a pirate map
treasure map whatever
the grips have so much shit in they literally look like a treasure map
arrr
crrusty
they be
the best feature of my mouse, and one that i fear i will miss when i inevitably have to replace it, is the button below the scroll wheel which turns it into a free wheel i can flick in either direction and have it really quickly spin down to the top/bottom of the page
yeah my brother's does that
best feature
I just use the scroll bar if I want to do that
too much wrist movement dude
hah
assassin's creed 3 remastered just announced
in you're interested
idk
if
I'm not
yeah didn't think so
not the best of their games

anyway go i to now goodbye bed

Why is this a meme
Just told a taxi driver to keep the change for a tenner on a 4.50 pound fare and he told me I was a 'great friend'
should have told him to keep hold of it for you for when he picks you up later
Well I ate a burger in his car so I feel like I owed him
ohhh
that changes things
yeah you were right to do that
Okay so my boss is dressed as the hulk
pics
Hold on
get a selfie with him
since you're leaving
Do they even know you're leaving yet
Obviously
What with the transfer
The notice
And me telling them I was a student when I applied
🙃
Do they even know you've applied?
Dude Idfk at this point
Mine is still under review
Same
Gonna apply for some more
!define plc

See I would have thought pussy licking cunts
Tbf that's what I'm typically thinking so
*oh you*
private limited company
i think
public
Can Thomas Bradley please come to the checkouts, thank you.
oh shit you're in trouble
Least I'm not dressed as the fucking hulk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnBhR8RLJN8
me want
well shit
i only restarted it
part of me wants it to be unrecoverable so i can go out and buy a beast windows laptop for the same price
I'm still tired
It doesn't even make sense
did you sleep
Yes
I got like 9 hours
hmm
i got about 6
and im fine as far as i can tell
i'll feel it later
More coffee
i dont drink coffee
Pussy
if i did i wouldn't be able to stop
apparently
i'd rather not get addicted to caffeine
Jesus Christ you're as bad as Tom
how
Alcohol
caffeine's more addictive
well
you drink it more anyway
so it happens faster
I guarantee people drink as much alcohol as they drink coffee
yet you don't see them getting up every 2 hours to make a cup of tea or coffee
there's a point in there somewhere
Dude you cannot seriously argue that caffeine addiction is more likely or worse than alcohol addiction
I'm genuinely sick of people acting as though my abstinence is a personal fucking attack on them
I'm running out of excuses like 'I'm a Buddhist monk'
i agree alcohol addiction is worse than caffeine addiction
I think the same about vegetarianism Tom
and the effects of drinking alcohol are larger and more noticeable than those of caffeine
Yeah it's not as though people think your a boring pussy who will eventually succumb to peer pressure, as if that's a good thing, just for being a vegetarian though
but i think caffeine addictions are way more common because you just dont realise since it's normal practice to drink caffeine nonstop every day
I don't get what's so special about booze
Is it anything like an orgasm?
Cos if not, stfu
It's like drugs
And I drink like 2 coffees a week
Which is pleasant
thats fine
i drink like 2 ciders a week
Perfect
Oh well you're a lightweight you pussy
I bet you literally aren't at all entertaining or happy when not completely hammered
Man up cunt
If you get properly plastered it is kind of like an orgasm
Like a slow one
Well it's not like it fucking tastes good
Cocktails do
That's there point
Their
Not strong enough pussy
They're
And I'm sure I prefer coke to them
They're stronger than beer
But whatever
I respect your choices
But that doesn't mean I can't question them
You sure Can, just don't pester me for an answer
Because that would make you a cunt
Alright cunt
Support me fuckdamnit
Oh look in such a fucking madlad
Gonna be so hammered ell oh ell
😱
!wotd
yeah the name thing
it's not working
my fault
!quote
!quote -l
!quote
Amen
!quote
say goodbye to !quote -l
well it still works but you don't need to do it anymroe
it updates when you pin shit
like it always should have
So did we have to wait until Monday to find out if you can get Wednesday off?
Do
yeah sorry
my bosses are dicks
No worries
If you can't take any day off next week it's fine
well tom's moving at the weekend
We'll just have to organize a trip to a bowling alley in reading
i guess
With a kickass arcade
Not in my city
why not
its mine
Share the toys
See
There's literally 3 just around my campus
One if them shares a name
They're on a roll?
ahaha i get it
https://giphy.com/gifs/food-roll-bread-3ov9k3sLKOdC06mpVu
well I found another song I want to learn on piano
what song's that
heart shaped box
interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo8jMCiuwuY&ab_channel=JonPumper
oh that's a nice cover
it works
yeah it does
I already got 3 other impossible things I want to learn
is this shorter than the original song
the chorus is like half as long
the first one anyway
idk dude
it's double the length of the actual one from that series
so it's kind of hard to tell
ugh you have to pay for the sheet
wow
I mean I can't read sheet music anyway
i have to squint
but that's still kinda dumb if you're already making a youtube video of it
i want to learn i'd do anything for love on piano
but
that's like 9 sheets of stuff
and complicated stuff
yeah some songs just don't repeat that much
so the sheet music is huge
well it's kinda prog rock
there's definitely repetition
I got some R.E.M guitar sheet music for my birthday
and most of them are reasonably straight forward
but there's one song that's like 7 pages
i should listen to REM
i know two songs
I only listen to the Best Of
so I know like 12
i usually don't listen to best ofs unless i just dont have the time
i like to put myself through the pain of listening to an entire discography
well I just sort of grew up listening to multiple different artist's best ofs
i recently added a Korn best of to my playlist
don't really need any more korn after that
since it's all the same kind of thing
they're like the foo fighters of industrial metal
I don't listen to industrial metal, or anything but the 3 most popular Foo Fighters songs
who's the bass player in the red hot chilli peppers?
flea
oh
that's a pretty skilled flea
big too
Michael Peter Balzary
alright, well the main thing is that I don't recognise them
meaning it's not who I thought it was
meaning I just won't bring this back up with my brother
the argument was already settled favourably
I had macaroni cheese and hot sauce for dinner
what did you have friend?
pizza
i have that too often
but
yeah
pizza
with pepperoni
it's hard to beat pizza
that's the trouble
if pizza suddenly became a bit less delicious
i'd be more confident about my health
you can always try making it yourself
makes it seem like a lot more effort
not a bad idea actually, didn't think of it like that
yeah, if you get good it tastes better too
although if you make it the way I do, it's hard to be bad
it's pretty simple
speaking of, I wonder what Tom can cook
I mean, he's moving out in like a week
I guess everyone can cook ready meals
https://purrli.com/
dude
we both have cats
yeah but mine is in the other room
or he might be outside
I don't let mine out after 9:30
well
my brother doesn't
I reckon he'd probably stay inside after 10 anyway
what if he needs a wee
well we give him dinner between 8 and 8:30
so he's got an hour to do whatever he had left over before dinner
then we let him out at the same time in the morning
hasn't needed to use the litter box for a while
so it must be alright
suppose so
our cat owns the entire road so he can go out whenever he wants
hah
my garden is so bad
the neighbours know to keep their cats in
my cat must love it
lol you should see mine
dude I pebbled mine
it had more weeds in now than it had before
nature has forsaken me
we have fucking bamboo too
which is pushing up the tiles in our neighbours garden
have been for about a year
I need a military gardener or something
get some agent orange
well then you'll just get a bunch of twigs
fine by me
I only wanted a bunch of rocks
at this rate we'll actually violate our lease
fingers crossed I can just move out before that happens
seems unlikely
wait so you're renting?
i pay rent
so yeah?
this house is pretty special too
we're the only people to have ever lived here
it was built for us to move into
wow
there's a big W of darker coloured bricks built into the side
for Watson
which was my mother's/grandmother's surname
that's cool
so it's not even like you were just the first buyers
it was actually built for you?
kinda
but like I said, we still pay rent
so I'm not even sure how that works
I guess we bought it before it was built
but not fully bought
do you own your house?
still paying for it
but yeah
it's not rented
my great grandmother on my maternal grandad's side used to own it
it got passed down to him
he used to rent it out to people
apparently some americans used to rent here and they worked at a military base somewhere nearby
and they called bodicote "bo-dick-a-tee"
anyway
he sold it to my parents for a very low mortgage
which was lucky
buut then shit hit the fan and now my dad gets half the profit we make when this is sold
either that or when zoe turns 18 we have to get a valuation and pay him half the profit we would make were we to sell it
as far as I know there's a similar deal on my house
that being said, we rent it
so can you even sell a house you rent?
wouldn't have thought so
that's why you shouldn't rent
you don't own the deed
but I think we own some of it
right but the landlord owns the house and has the final say
well
I should really ask more questions about this house
the specifics are probably outlined in the tenancy agreement
like I've never read that
this stupid shit with the house has basically encouraged me to fully read any contract i sign that has to do with big stuff like insurance, housing etc
im not getting fucked over like we did
yeah, that is something we should do anyway though
that's what I learnt in maths anyway
in maths?
oh
rtfq?
run the fuck queue?
what else?
that's what I'm saying
read the full question
from Mr Something
or as i say in my head
read the fucking question
but i think that's a mix of read the full question and read the fucking manual
yeah kinda
but also that it's incredibly easy to get lots of money from idiots
so don't be those idiots
dude we could make a business that does just that
in any way possible
those are called scams
they're pretty ludicrous affairs as far as I'm aware
not a scam if it's technically legal
like
idk
a pyramid scheme
selling a mobile phone for $1300
cough
🍎
give a person £10 credit for paying £5, and getting two friends to do the same
isn't that illegal though
it's fraud
pretty sure that's legitimately what Giff Gaff does
except it's one friend
but to activate their sim they have to top up £10
so they get £20 for £15
and then they can get another £10 for £5
if they find another friend
but it's free to ask for a sim from them
so you could technically just keep doing that between the same two people
if you repeatedly changed sims
and kept making new accounts
that's not really a proper pyramid scheme though because everyone gets the same thing
giffgaff just makes a profit
yeah I know
because they're a business
that's why it's legal
it's kinda the same thing as 3 for 2
isn't a pyramid scheme only illegal when they cut and run?
yeah essentially if there's a promise of money which isn't fulfilled
what if you just sold really expensive plastic cups
with a pyramid scheme style friend system
where do you get the cups from
make em
take a knife to a water bottle
and how would the friend system work
so someone pays you £5 for a cup
they get a cup
isn't the idea of a pyramid scheme that there's a promise of profit
like an investment
and you tell them they get another cup, which sells for another £5 were they to sell on
a hedge fund
if they get two friends to also buy a cup
obviously the cups cost next to nothing to produce
so you're still making a net profit
and you could just end that particular offer
and actually produce the cups
seeing as how they cost less than £5 to make
wait half a year
do it again
as long as you had proper order reference numbers for the cups and stuff
yeah that would probably be fine
NO REFUNDS
when i see that i walk in the opposite direction
yeah, although I see it a reasonable amount online
nothing screams "we think this guitar is awful and not worth they money so much so that we will not allow you to get your money back if you don't like it" than a no refunds sign
oof on a guitar shop?
that's a yikes
i bought a guitar probably like 8 years ago from the tiny guitar shop opposite the pet shop near white lion walk
not one man band
the other one
yeah idk dude
yeah nobody went there because they were shit
got the guitar home
and you decided you wanted a guitar from there
hey
learn from mistakes
righty
you get it home
it wouldn't stay in tune
legit something wrong with the neck
like there was too much tension or something
but it was such a cheap model that there wasn't really a mechanism for tweaking it
yeah
same thing with my brother's electric, only not quite as bad
anyway we take it back to the shop and they had since put up a NO REFUNDS sign in the door
you got a receipt right?
yeah probably i can't remember
it's probably an ikea desk now
i think we took it to the tip
more out of anger than productivity
could've sold it for parts
well maybe the strings
not sure what else
im sure there's someone out there who buys cheap 3/4 classical guitars and swaps parts out
yeah probably
I bet they have a youtube channel too
and a fucking tumblr
hah yeah
probably make guitars out of matchboxes
then sell them for more than a normal guitar because famous youtuber
you just reminded me
with matchboxes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9c-_neaxeU
when you have 14 mins to spare
and a curiosity for how machine learning works
it works slowly
cuz it has to cross off every other posibility
that would work
but it would be very slow
there are faster ways to do it
yeah, you build a computer to learn faster ways for that computer to learn
that's exactly what a neural network is
imagine a big pile of matchboxes that have different coloured pieces in them that weight the random selection of ways to organise a bunch of other piles of matchboxes that all do what happens in that video
the matchboxes that lead to the piles of matchboxes that master the game faster get weighed down more so they are more likely to be picked
something like that anyway
it's just a really good demonstration
fair enough
I'll bookmark it
no I won't
I'll add it to my youtube queue
woah
how do you do that
might actually get watched that way
save to
my youtube is still in german and i don't know what the word for queue is
watch later
oh
watch later
it's the one with three lines and the plus
später ansehen
ja
yeah that's quite full for me
watching them doesn't remove them from the list
78 videos
yeah it's really annoying
and i just add more than i watch
yep
because most of them are videos that im not interested enough to watch straight away but dont want to just ignore them
yep
best thing youtube have done relatively recently is the red bar across the thumbnail so you can roughtly see how far through a video you were when you clicked off it
and whether you have watched it
and it's also really great when it works
about 50% of the time
hahah
precisely
guess what i got today
high?
before that
laid?
haha no not that
or worse, *expelled*
guess
umm
a guitar?
that'd be nice
no
i got
a
denim jacket
hahahah
i can't wait
i think it suits me
i think we'll be the judges of that
i thought of getting a denim flat cap as well
maybe start off with just double
don't want you to get ahead of yourself
better yet
only wear the jacket without jeans
perfect
it's a different shade of blue
so the effect doesn't really work
how different?
white to navy?
the frequencies of light that are absorbed by the two garments result in differing spectral absorption lines
hardyhar
my jeans are dark the jacket is light
eeh
both blue
could be fine
fine in a serious or ironic sense?
that's definitely the better way around
well
fine-r
that doesn't answer my question
I'm not saying there aren't people who look good in double denim, I'm saying those people are fucking models
!define mosel
ffs
uh
dafuq
I wish my lights were that talkative
they just sit there and judge me
the ones at work are buzzing
they won't shut up
hah
I have a bedside one that is so bright
definitely got a future ahead of him
brilliant
what's a screen's favourite type of meat?
gamma-n
took me a while to get that one
dont have to remember the word gammon often
the old ones are the best
what's a rockstar's favourite cereal?
special K
that actually relies on a varied knowledge of both drugs and feminine cereals

> this is sure to piss someone off
😡
Look dude I don't know how hard it's going be
But fine
Fucking thursday
Which Thursday dude
Why are you so bloody pedantic
There are quite a lot of Thursdays in a year
It's good to be precise
Especially since you're going on about some date in December
Got called into a meeting room this morning because someone needed help connecting their laptop to the tv to present something
They had a mac
With no HDMI port
They had a lightning to VGA adaptor
And we have no reason to stock a female to female hdmi/vga adaptor
So I told them we didn't have that and he was like ok nevermind thanks for trying
10 mins later I get called back in, they're trying to set up the projector
Since the projector has a VGA connection
But I don't think the projector liked the adaptor because it refused to work
This is why you don't buy a fucking Mac you piece of shit, I said
Anyway they tried using a windows laptop instead that someone else had
This didn't have a VGA port so we had to go back to the tv
Plugged the HDMI into the laptop from the tv
Nothing
Because her laptop is so shit that the shitty integrated CPU graphics don't even support a secondary monitor mirroring the first
So I basically told them that they're a bunch of cunts and they should invest more in technology if they want to get a fucking presentation working
And I told high-pitched-bloke-cunt that if he really wants to be a fucking useless idiot and use a mac then he should at the very least buy a lightning to HDMI adaptor
Who the fuck still uses VGA right?
What a bunch of fimbles
I do
For everything
Why
That was a much better photo 5 minutes ago

Also bullshit someone plays on a fight pad with a ring on
And with *those* nails
The fuck is a fight pad
Game pad made specifically for fighting games
Speed my man
Speed
Is it like one of those full arcade style £2000 driving game experience boxes
Umm
No
It's a game pad
Do you put it on your lap
Kinda like using a wheel for a driving game, only infallibly better than using a controller
After you relearn all the controla
And you put it where you want
S
Well it's a game pad, so the controls are mappable
Yeah but if I had a ps4 controller then not only do I know what button does what, but I know where those buttons are, so you can kind of remove the middleman and link thumb action to a specific game action
All that muscle memory
Gone
Just trust me
In the blink of an eye
Like a deer on a motorway
If you need to press buttons fast and accurately
In rush hour
At midnight
On a snowy day
Well
It's a game pad that's gonna win
A snowy night
In israel
Ain't no deer in Israel fool

inb4 tom says he's booked up until the 13th of december
oh guaranteed
but that doesn't mean we'll believe him
quite right
he'll have to pull out some serious shit
I was about to give an example but I'm too afraid he'd actually do it
just out of spite
dude samsung and huawei are making foldable phones
why has nobody thought of this
didn't apple start doing it
but then they realised they could make more money if they only made them slightly bendy
don't think they're that thin yet
because then people would still break them
I already booked an alley for the 13th
fuck you motherfucker fuckass go to fuck
me and isaac are going bowling this thursday
*Isaac and I
that can't be right
then you have I and are together

it's worth watching just for the segue at the end
I need to buy my great-aunt a birthday present
a great-present
well that is yet to be determined
it better be
the only thing she does is read
she watches TV but I'm not buying her one of those
her son is
so it wouldn't even be an original idea
Nat's buying her a DVD
my sister's buying her some flowers
so I'm looking up crime novels
but they all sound like trash
like, why are so many books published every year?
theyre all the same
it's like watching a soap opera
does she have a dvd player for Nat's dvd?
yeah
that's what Nat got her last year
get her a blu ray player
just to irk Nat
he already considered that last year
not really worth it
yeah no
I mean, not even because of the extra cost
how tech-savvy is your great aunt
just because then you can't really borrow dvds
well
she's not great
but
surely you can play dvds on a bluray player
that being said, she is learning to use an iphone and an ipad
and basically knows how to use her laptop
she just never has a reason to use it
yeah good point
but regardless
does she have a celebrity crush
get her an embroidery of her favourite dashing hollywood actor
oh jesus christ
that might be the worst thing I've ever heard
thank you
you're welcome
I'm not going to do it
ever
*ever*
but thank you
well i know what to get you for christmas
hahahah
but who's my favourite hollywood actor Jamie?
i didn't say favourite
eww
fuck
i said favourite
yeah you did
and dashing
but if memory serves
you recently listed the most handsome actors in your opinion
and i think at the top of the list it was Ryan Gosling
hmmm
they were just people who are more handsome than Tom
oh
but I could probably settle for Gosling
memory does not serve
I have two favourite actors though
only one of them was on that list
and one of them isn't exactly a hollywood actor
dude didn't even know english for half of his career
ewan mcgregor didn't speak english for half his career?
what about my sentences implied they were the same one?
what about my question implied i was actually making an informed guess given both clues?

hey Jamie do you have a bass guitar?
acoustic bass yeah
why
just wondering
I know you have all those guitars
pretty sure you've told me that before though
i daren't get an electric bass because this house shakes like fuck when i use a normal guitar amp
yeah
if i got a bass amp it would just be worse
brings a new meaning to the term homewrecker
it gets worse
if you buy cheap kit
you get a resonating note
which resonates with the walls of the room you're in
making it really fucking loud
and it's one specific note
dude, you could just knock down houses with *SOUND*
terrorist attack by means of slappin the bass
sorry that was a very 12 yr old joke
I bet terrorists have terrible taste in music
hmm
i wonder if the manchester guy was a fan of ariana grande
you know when you say something edgy
and you don't get an immediate response
and you think
have i gone over the edge
I know what you mean
but I just don't know what you're refering to
the manchester arena bomber
assumably there was a terrorist attack in manchester
at the ariana grande concert
yeah I figured that too
well you figured right
congratulations
many people died
and they moved my fucking concert venue
hah
to a fucking cricket ground
how were the acoustics
notorious for being shit at sound
oh let me tell you
bad
it was bad
i couldn't hear
anything
i could make out a tiny bit
but most of it was kshhsshhsh
bfbffffff
apparently they had it much better in the front standing
obviously
but the point of an arena is that everyone can fucking hear the stuff
yeah but you don't really need to hear much stuff in cricket
wouldn't want to have your 5 hour rant about taxes interrupted
is that what people do when they watch cricket
idk dude, I don't know anyone who watches cricket
I just assume they're rich
that's tennis
well
sporting events are probably just really expensive
yeah
but especially wimbledon
biggest in the world
probably
fuck looking it up
!define wimbledon
ohohohohohoh
idea
dude how long has it been since Tim Henman played?
i only know him as a name
is your idea to make Jimmy Carr and Boris Johnson play tennis together?
aheeheeheeeheeheeh
that would be a wondrous sight
https://giphy.com/gifs/boris-johnson-bojo-3o85xDazgkTMedOX8A
did he check if he was alright
i can't remember
i've seen that many times
dude he doesn't care
point is
Boris boris Boris boris boris boris Boris boris
sports day at cunt school
I've never seen Reddie Edmayne in an interview
he could be chill
looks like he still wasn't over that Hawking gig though
yeah he's alright
so is andy murray
I concur
no idea who the middle guy is
or the one to the left
was just about to say that
looks like Matthew McConaughey on uppers
uppers?
drugs
to make you active
the opposite of downers
pretty sure there's a scientific term for it
but I don't remember it
steroids?
hah no
like the classification of alcohol
it slows your synapses
so it's a depressant
but the opposite
is an upper
impressant
also uppers and downers might be specific drugs
expressant
idfk
tom will answer
I'm sure he will
angrily to boot
oh
it's Tim Henman
well I clearly know the same amount about him as you do
indeed

i've seen more a's

it just sounds like a name out of a comic book
yeah i can kinda see tha
t
also Graham is a reasonably rare name
my Year 1 teacher was called Miss Graham
or Mrs
i don't remember her *that* well
decent teacher
far better than Year 2
oh my god
my year two teacher
she was one of those people who use every vowel sound when saying "no"
I think that's just every old teacher
Miss Moore used to do that
people didn't like her
but she was sarcastic
so that was enough for me
what was your year two teacher's name?

yeah i figured
you wanna move to reading?

dude i have too much shit
yeah me too
like too much for a van
well, maybe not a big van
just gotta leave stuff dude
come back for it later
or don't
i have to clear the room so alex can have it
half the shit in here is sam's
hah
can't you just move it into Alex' room?
or is someone taking that
idk
hey you could move in
because another dude is exactly what that household needs
you know of any female candidates?
jo called me the 'Emperor of Wank' earlier today, and i gotta say, kinda liked it my man
pretty sure I only know 4 female people at all, and one of them already lives there
it's got catch that's for sure
he made me get a female companion mod in fallout 4 because she was 'sexy'
i think hes a bad influence tbh
hah
how old is he again?

eesh
tbf at 10 I was paying for sex in Fable
on the living room TV
yeah you werent pretending to jerk off at the same time tho
good point
wasn't even totally aware of the concept
I've started leaving food in the kitchen instead of my room and I think I'm losing weight
Not because I'm not eating it but because I have to move to get it
hah
I started counting my calories a while back
and I definitely lost some weight
til I got bore
d
although I had exactly three meals today
It's okay if I'm just eating fruit and packaged meals at tesco
Then that shit is accurate
But when I have to measure out every ingredient if a home cooked meal and guess like fucking mad
It takes ages and is definitely wrong
yeah
I just round up
well, sometimes
It doesn't even assume it's cooked
I gave up eventually but if I didn't eat at home I wouldnt even hit 2000 calories a day
yeah mug shots state the values per 100g, but the 100g are mostly water
Can't wait for that to go to shit
because it assumes you put the exact stated amount of water in
Oh dude if the package makes me do maths
Fuck off
hah
well the campus seemed to have plenty of food stores
should be at least some variation
Yeah I can eat oriental

back to the future was ingenious
they made the same film 3 times
and just changed the time period
its known as a joyless cashgrab
men in black?
why  doesnt that sound accurate?
I dont even know how many of those there were
i think 3
i hope it isnt more, which is nice
I coulda sworn it was 4
cause i know theres still some optimism left in me
and you killed it
no it is 3
look

huh
nvm I guess
for fucks sake
no reason there cant be four of those
I just realised gay couples probably watch gay porn together
made me feel weird
but happy
but mostly weird
most couples dont watch porn together
thats like a weird thing to do
hey
if they're both into porn
and thats walt disneys auristic cat saying that
fuck
dude I bet like, 40% of couples have watched porn together
that's actually a really bad bet
I take it back
I mean, there are still amish people about
im not sure they account for any of the couples porn shit
and i still think its fucking weird
bit of a cop out
I just figure gay couples are more up on the times
ergo, more open to porn
most people see their partner watching porn as a form of cheating
yeah
I know a couple that broke up over it
still see them like, every other fireworks night
jesus how many do you attend
the same one every year
well
except when I don't see any
it's always after the actual day
usually near the start of december
so it makes even less sense to the neighbours
but they do it every year so, maybe not
at this point youre running circles around me
my dad knows some weird people in Reading
that is all

smoking?

actually
smoking is a well tested pastime
as is the word posh in my family
but less so universally

or were you trying to say something else?
like BOSH

again im having an out of body experience here
i really ought to appreciate my in body experiences more
hah
it's all those downers dude
yeah speaking of which im almost fully incapable of feeling emotion anymore
unless i stub my toe or something
hey, at least you're still capable of feeling physically
which is worse?

Until someone says "ha yeah but if it were in C# the class would need to have the same name as the file"
i was just wondering if there was such thing as a regular polyhedron with 3 faces
and i came across this rather amusing image
can you see what's wrong with it
theres too many faces on icosahedron
nope
It's a stupid picture
And the first one has 4 sides
And the second has 6
faces

im getting the bus into town tomorrow
anyone want a lift
Hah
Same
What time?
bus leaves at 12:40
so im gonna get there at like 1
if im lucky
more likely 1:10
Right
Well mine's at 12:15
its difficult to predict
because the bus route's changed
ah
you'll definitely be early then
Yeah
isn't there a later one
But that's the plan

oh my god its you

oh
no
im not a grammamar nazzi
https://jimpix.co.uk/words/random-username-generator.asp
see that
im currently in contact with the owner of this site
and he's developing a backend to this username generator out of the goodness of his heart
just so that i can use a better random username generator for my bot
im doing the entire software engineering industry a huge favour
well he is
Christ dude
ikr
i sent a message on the contact form on the website on the offchance that they might reply with a canned message like "thank you for your enquiry blah blah we are currently working on an API it will be ready in octember 2054 see you then"
its just one guy
who has learned how to make an API since my original email
and is now working on it
Ffs
hey
free better usernames
probably sooner than 2054
the trick is to respond to his emails showing enough gratitude to appear kind but not quite enough gratitude to morally lock him into doing this
Well considering he's already trying to do it
He's probably just amazed someone contacted him at all
good point
kinda feel bad for the guy
nice *job*
I mean, I certainly wouldn't have contacted someone for something like that
oh dude if i had a website with under 1000 visitors since i installed the counter on my homepage then i would jump off a cliff if somebody wrote in and suggested it
i didn't specifically ask for it
i asked whether there was one
dude you knew damn well there wasn't gonna be one for some random back water site
you never know
if you don't ask you don't get
said Keith Lemon in that ad
what ad
i don't go to keith lemon for life advice
not near as much as i should anyway
somehow not the answer I was expecting
come on i don't watch all the same adverts you do
not what I meant, but regardless this ad was on a *lot*
like 4 months straight
what was the ad for
i might remember it if you give me a bit more info
uh
keith lemon has been in a lot of ads
phone deals?
I think
it wasn't a straight forward ad
also what the fuck kind of tagline is that for an advert
nobody wants to advertise that you have to actually make contact with someone to get something
well that's exactly what they were advertising
I guess to sell the idea that they had good customer service
which I can see people finding appealing
not me though
I prefer a phone company with no customer service whatsoever
they rely on users to answer user's questions
and god knows they're better at it than employees
i wouldn't mind my phone listening in on me if only just to pick up me saying things like "i wish this fucking phone would let me dismiss an alarm 2 minutes before it goes off so i don't have to fucking wait to take a piss until after my alarm goes off and i dismiss it"
yeah mine only lets me dismiss alarms that are half an hour away
usually I just turn them off and back on again after 2 minutes
not a bad idea actually
though i'd probably just forget to turn it back on
yeah, the fix for that is be less forgetful
although I just check my alarms before going to bed every night
yeah i don't have time for that shit
but you have time to wait for two minutes before taking a piss
oh yeah i have time for that in the same sense that if i fall down a 12ft hole on the way to the post office then i guess i have time to stay there and wait to be rescued
because there's no other alternative
other than, of course, the one I just suggested
and you flippantly dimissed
because it would take too much time
https://giphy.com/gifs/LTpmRMNSmZgIw
isaac i wouldn't remember to check my alarms
neither do I
but I never have to get up in the morning
and even when my alarms do go off
I wake up, turn them off, and go back to bed
i might learn korean
it would be interesting to hear what the two countries have to say without the need for translation
you can't really get an idea of tone from english news reports alone
well to an extent
it's quite easy to tell anger from peace
but the smaller underlying tones that aren't translated easily
true
but then you have to rely on your own translations
and currently those are far less reliable than professionals
yeah but have you heard bbc live translations
they just say the words they hear
with no emotion at all
let alone the natural flow of speech
i listened to Dark Side of the Moon the other day
for the first time
and it made me go

ideas for lunch
i had toast for breakfast
don't really want toast again
went to shop
they for some reason don't have sausage rolls
all we have in is bread
what can i do with bread that isn't toast
i don't have anything to put in a sandwich mind
You could soak it in egg
Then fry it
im a vegan
You're an asshole is what you are
it would help if i knew how to do anything more complex than make toast
crisps are good for you right?
Not as good as French toast
i had a crunchie
im well fed now
nothing beats a healthy lunch once in a while
Co-op didn't have any Frijjs

good luck

Good luck with your empty cupboards

Cunt
i've successfully muted every single audio device on my laptop except the bluetooth earphones
thought you might like to know
80 fucking pounds
20 actually
the packaging was a nightmare
they had packaged it in such a way that it was impossible to get the earphones out without cutting it up
so i probably can't return them if i needed to
it says on the manual that it has a bluetooth range of 1m
which is fucking awesome
worth the £80
i can go to the other side of the house and still get an alright signal if i stand completely still
also my ankle is very delicate right now
Yeah my headphones are pretty good for distance too, they're not Bluetooth though
you sure it isn't just a bluetooth dongle?
Maybe, but then doesn't that kinda defeat the point of Bluetooth
not really it just means you can use it on devices that don't support bluetooth
the alternative means using wifi
which would mean going via the router
which is just inconvenient
Couldn't it just be any wireless signal technology
i guess but the most developed one is bluetooth
But yeah it's probably Bluetooth
i don't know of any other wireless signal thing that's not bluetooth or wifi
it would need special software/hardware
which i mean
if you've got a dongle
it's definitely possible
but i think most wireless mouse/keyboards are basically bluetooth
idk
80
that clearly says £19.99
where?
you know where
its not about the priiice taaaaag

For 80 pounds I think you want to get them back

You can just sit on it then huh?
Yeah
Might have to get me some ethereum
What are you using
Coinbase
There's a fee so it's not really worth investing less than 150
Basically i have to wait until my wallet goes above 157.98 to cash out because it's 3.99 to deposit and a further 3.99 to withdraw
I could cash out now but why the fuck would I do that
Set aside an afternoon for setting it up
And write your passwords on paper not your pc
Uhhhhhh
i think i downloaded a thing called moneybox where youre supposed to use the app to invest a couple percent extra on every purchase you make into an investment they choose

And is the news like spoilers for real life?
modern day
in assassin's creed
the game where you run around in the past
Umm
but really you're asleep
Yeah I know
it's made by ubisoft
You didn't real answer my joke question
Really
oh sorry
YEAH HAHA IT'S NORTH KOREA'S MISSILE PLANS HAHAHA BUT WOULDN'T WANT TO SPOIL IT
Exactly
I didn't mean it
how's Bangor?
Nightmareb
I don't drink
Lul
so did you get your primary choice?
what the fuck
my sister's listening to thom yorke
maybe her friend told her to
that was the only way my sister would start doing something
ha
possible
pretty sure she only went to school when her friends told her to
and then she must have caught on
idk
don't blame her
homework's just classwork the teachers can't be bothered to set in class
yeah that's how I felt too
depends on the class though
some subjects do have a lot to get through
and I guess the teachers just don't feel able to fit it all into the allotted lessons
so you could argue that a better teacher would be able to give less homework
easier to say all that having dropped out
i think if the subject has too much to get through then there's too much on the curriculum
there certainly is
simple as that
if you want to learn more
there's further education
I mean think about the curriculum for history
like 3 different choices of two choices in the exam
oh those fucking exams where you have to learn fucking everything because you don't know which subject is gonna come up
that's a fucking farce
I mean they're trying to teach you all of it
although that begs the question why they don't just ask you all of it
exactly
yeah idk dude
you could have done like five times as much studying for the actual examined topics if you actually knew which the examined topics were
but I had to do maths the other day, and it kind of made me miss those pointless maths scenarios
and when I was writing a birthday card yesterday, my handwriting sucks
because you don't need to write anymore
you just type
nakajune'iapatebo has 67 watermelons
he splits those watermelons between 0.2456x10^5 people
across a space of 4m by 320inches
in a right angle triangle
how long will this take?

✏
you may not use a calculator
*never*
I mean wasn't the calculator paper essentially the one that didn't need calculators
and the non-calc was the one that they really needed them you just weren't allowed
they gotta train you for when you're lost in the wild with no electricity and you gotta smash out some mathematical equations
Gordon Freeman style
i would get that reference if i played half life 2 for more than 10 minutes
it's not really mentioned in the game itself
and do you not like half-life?
it's never really stuck out to me
i find it's more like a physics demo than a game
do you play any fps' other than tf2?
*does minecraft count*
hahahah
that being said though
I'm struggling to think of any really amazing fps games
that aren't somehow bending the genre
well there's usually more to it than just fps
I would say CoD is just an fps
like maybe it's multiplayer or singleplayer
Mirror's Edge is a first person platformer
so not really a shooter
and then within multiplayer there's team v team, battle royale (which sounds like a burger), co-op all that shit
Bioshock
co-op exploration shit
Bioshock is good
co-op l4d style with waves
m.knight shamalien plot
i like the slender concept
im thinking of making some kind of game where you can't see very far ahead
but not in a dark forest
slender is a horror game though
more like a horror arcade game
but still
Bioshock is kind of an rpg I guess
i keep meaning to play that
i think i have all the games
not entirely sure what the core element of its gameplay is
atmosphere
strategy
action
adaptation
yeah wouldn't mind a bit of that
choice
it's a mixed bag
in the best way
bioshock infinite is good too, although a lot less tense
which i kind of liked about the first (2)
kinda swapped out the tension for more action
faster pacing
i like the genre of game where you can pause a fucking cutscene
hahah
yeah me too
can't remember the first game that let me do that
for a while I wouldn't have even noticed because I was too scared to try
i opened the assassin's creed modern day pictures
wow dude
that took no time at all
im the kind of person who downloads a leaked early copy of a radiohead album that has been recorded on a phone from a car radio
Why bother
It just means when it comes to the real thing
It's ruined
yeah well
remember what modern day is like in origins
Scaled back
i wasn't holding out much hope for it to be particularly groundbreaking
and the pictures are not very revealing at all
As far as I'm aware the majority of players don't particularly care for it anyway
I do
me too
i think it's a shame
I think it's a shame you dislike tons of stuff
they basically got a bunch of different overarching plotlines and then ignored them and tied them all up in a comic series 20 people will read
I think it's a shame Barry manilow looks so ugly now
plenty more fish isaac
don't worry about that
But none of them are *him*
get a body pillow then
Omg
A Barry manilow body pillow
🤢
they should make a four-dimensional body pillow of the doctor so you can turn it inside out multiple times and have it change between all the doctors
i don't actually know if you can do that with four dimensions
certainly can't do it with three
What do you know, I don't know either
or james bond
but then the whole 4d thing becomes less relevant
that reminds me
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-6099475/Danny-Boyle-quit-James-Bond-plans-kill-regenerate-like-Doctor-Who.html
that would not go down well
isn't that the idea behind there being so many actors?
they actually just die
but there's always a 007 as opposed to any other number because it's the best
like a superstitious failsafe
like in the books I mean
whatever
making it the plot of the movie seems unnecessary
i think in the past when the actors change in james bond, they don't even acknowledge it
the first time they did was when voldemort became M
They don't but it's implied
Due to the books
maybe it's all the same agent but in very good disguise skinsuits

Room tour
needs posters
Fuck you
aw fuck now i got 2 wifi
boom thats 3 wifi
i can literally do anything
I got 0 wifi right now
But 4 gs
And I'm on the way back from Birmingham
do people actually hide behind sofas
they're really pushing that narrative
i don't think anyone's ever done that
So you got your wifi sorted then Tom?
Room looks aight too
not enough posters
Well I'm sure we'll have rectified that by Christmas
Fucks same
How about another 4 fallout posters
Hah
So you got your second choice for accommodation Tom?

Hey Tom you ever played L.A Noire?
Nope
huh
well it's pretty good
Yeah that seems to be the general consensus
pretty sure the developers crashed though
whilst trying to make 'Whore of the Orient'
Hey Tom you ever played Battlefield 2: Bad Company?
Not yet
I was going to some time this week
it's pretty good
There's a jinjutsu class on tomorrow
I imagine it's just going to be a lot of people kicking me
But there's all sorts of shit I should probably be doing this week
like what?
Well barring the pub crawls and socials there's club's and societies
Some of which revolve around people who don't drink
There's a video game one that will host call of duty tournaments
And I'm really good at cod
Not 'Chris Jarret, raper of dogs named Rex' good, but 'better than normie cuck' good
yeah fair enough
I guess every club's quality depends on who attends it
Trust me dude
Next year I'll be the one running these fucking events
I'm the next ninja
Except I won't be streaming minecraft with guns
hahah
They've got a ps3 apparently
I'm not sure if that's just the one
But I saw they either do mw3 or black ops
I'm only good at blackops
Point is their treasurer is female and she's the only one with a photo for her profile
the video game club has a treasurer?
So obviously if I come top of the leader board she's legit obligated to let me rub my scrotum against her eyebrows
Ikr
I have to pay a fiver to get in
Hopefully that's not monthly
christ
Yeah I'm vexed
honestly sounds like they have less of a PS3 collection than you do rn
I think non-students can join
Ikr
But you should move down and join my fucking clan
We'll be called the rug munchers
and you know if they played anything other than only CoD I'd be all over that
And people will be pissed that were not actually lesbos
Oh they play other things
There's also a larping club
wowie
who's the treasurer for that
Some fucking nerd
I fucking suck at all of those
I think
huh
I'm actually above par at Rocket League
above par in the sense that I'm good at it, not in the golf sense
Smash 4?
Super Smash Bros
hmm
it's sounding less worse
and it sounds like one dude there plays pokemon
could probably crush them
I think that might be the final straw
I don't want the school shooting up
what?

also saying it like that makes it sound like mass drug usage
Get my ass kicked in self defence classes and on halo
Can't wait for a 12 year old to yell in American about how he fucks my mum as he tea bags my dead ass Spartan
I should bring them my collection
And yeah there's no tekken
yeah I know, I said that to myself after reading that they're open to suggestions
then I realised that I'm not even attending the fucking uni, I'm hardly in a position to be saying what games the video game club should have
what series should i watch
Don't speak to yourself you spaz
what series should i watch
alright mr Doc Johnson
I tell you what
I'll rape a fucking bitch on Mario kart 8
that would be a heinous oversight on the developers part and I would love to see such an exploit
also I'm thinking Jamie

Hey man the non student cost is only £6.15
https://giphy.com/gifs/jesus-payback-dance-rgtnnViLq7Aoo
it's a torrent site
that seems like a weirdly accurate percent increase
and isn't everything a torrent website these days
also my internet speed is shitting
It's £5.15 for me
nvm then
but why the extra 15 pence?
because otherwise it would be £5
and that would be simply unaffordable
it's probably something stupid like electricity costs or something
but I'm assuming it has to be in cash
which must be kinda ass
getting a bunch of 10s and 5s
or needing them
That's for a year tho
that's cool
cuz that a week would be lame
so does rarbg have everything?
i would say it has a lot
it doesn't have everything
but
it has almost everything
right well, that's not why I wasn't going to suggest Preacher
but there are annoying popups
I wasn't going to suggest Preacher because you have an element of old man in you
and I can only imagine an old man would NOT like Preacher
how am i an old man
I said an *element* of old man
a certain properness
i think that's just a personality trait
you don't become proper with age
you become more easily offendable
personality trait again
I dont know any old people who enjoy you swearing at them
Tom however
not phased
yeah but tom's tom
It has lots of things in it that I feel people might call 'unnecessary'
hell even I don't like certain things that are 'unnecessary'
yeah i prefer good tv
yeah see that's exactly my point
im winding you up
regardless
Westworld is good as long as you don't mind tits in every other shot
not one to watch at work then
not exactly no
best thing to watch at work is fucking blue planet
really
is that the david attenborough program
it is
anything else and you get judged
im not really into nature documentaries
of course you aren't
i've already watched doctor who in front of everyone
luckily i was still on classic who when i started watching it at lunch
so they knew i was serious
gross
idk then, there aren't that many great BBC shows I can think of
have you watched killing eve yet
if not
seriously do
what is it
psychopath russian assassin woman assassinating various targets in and around europe while a group of mi6 agents try to track her down, but the mi6 agent woman develops feelings for the assassin
and it's sort of black-comedy-esque
kinda sounds
old
like
like maybe an old man would enjoy it
stfu
it's a seat-edge-er
well if i didn't watch it in bed
I'm winding you up

Electric Dreams is alright
but it's ITV
Merlin I watched all of
it's BBC but I'm not entirely sure about quality
and it's probably not even on iplayer
i've heard things about merlin
i can't remember if they were good or bad
i have a thing that can download iplayer videos
i have everything
i just realised
well some of the stuff is still on the internet
but it's all
at my fingertips
yeah
even drugs
hey man can i buy some drugs from you please
my son would like some drugs
why did i say that
must be on drugs
Robin Hood
i used to like
same quality as Merlin
I watched all of the Musketeers but meh
it'd probably help if you knew what kind of stuff i liked
it would help me too lol
I can't think of many other series
of anything
Life on Mars
watch that
rick wakeman did the piano for that song
wonderful
I don't think he did shit for the series
Snatch is a good film

Aw dude it's weird being back here

Get off the crack homie
*24 minutes*
AAAAAAH
hey jamie
youre a computer man
What did you break
i keep getting a DNS error when i try to play gta online using a bridged connection from my ps3 to my laptop
Well DNS is the thing that maps a website URL to an IP address
I don't really understand the problem
When you say a bridged connection what do you mean
im using an ethernet to bridge a connection to my laptop
my laptop can acess wifi but my ps cant
Right so you want your laptop to pass the internet through to your ps
that would be nice
Does your ps have network settings
indeed
Can you send a pic
haha everything is on 'automatic'
hold on
Most of it can probably stay on auto
Could you get the same settings up on your laptop
Command prompt, ipconfig
On your ps
Can you ping
Is there a way to do that
no
Well that's good design isn't it
ikr
i could just buy an adapter i think
but that would be money
Does it have an internet browser
yeah
would be hard pressed to use it for much
Try and go to Google.com
i get the same DNS error
Now try and go to 216.58.204.14
okay hold on
ive managed to sign into psn which means i can play online and use the browser
but eventually it will fuck me with a DNS error
So did the ip address load Google?
still loading
Ok
oh we got there
Ok
So you're getting a connection through it's definitely your DNS servers
Can you change your DNS settings?
yep
Try changing the primary one to 208.67.222.222
And the secondary to 208.67.220.220
yeah i tried this previously
ill do it again tho
Oh ok
If it didn't work
Change your primary DNS to the same IP as your default router
which is that?
the ip4 address?
10.30.88.254
oh ok
what about the secondary?
Just leave it
failed to even get an internet connection this time
Is this how you usually used the internet on your ps3
no i used the wifi
but theres something that restricts the ps from connecting to the wifi here
Right
If you do 'Test Connection' on the PS it should essentially ping
Yeah but is that just pinging the same address
What the DNS
I guess
Idk
It just checks if the issue is psn or the connection or hopefully the dns
Or if it all works then you get speeds
Tom is your laptop connected to wifi or wire
wifi
Ok
theres an ethernet port in here and i have a second cable now
if that helps at all
tried the same settings again and i seem to have a connection this time
You get that mail yet Tom?
Nice
i could get to this point before
after about 10 mins online of not being able to contact rockstar servers i would be booted off playstation network due to a DNS error
Sorry people are walking around me a bunch atm it's really annoying
Well first things first the Ps3 rockstar servers kinda suck, but that does sound weird
Go to your network adapters page on your laptop
Right click your wifi card
Properties
Advanced tab
there aint an advanced
Sharing tab?
just configure
no sharing is turned off when you use a bridge
Don't do that then
You need to go to the sharing tab and check the allow other users to connect box
alright sharing is on
Ok gimme a sec
lol same it crashed windows
Hah
Wow
Hey dude you're online
Well this website is wrong
Ignore everything I said
my god
I can see his Psn online
yeah thats not really the issue
Fair enough
i can still get online for the most part, i just cant connect to servers
Can you wait till saturday
Might have to make a site visit
oohhh shit
we can totally do that
i got a pizza coupon right after isaac and i bought dominos
Neato
Dude I've had so much pizza
do you want to see my blister?
When I got home last night we went to pizza express
why?
i just fucking fed you
My fucking aunt is why
And then I had pizza hut for lunch today
well stop it
My intestines are gonna be annoyed
you sit there and criticise my diet
Hahaha tom
Thaaanks
I criticise mince and onion
Neil asked me about video games
Btw
who in fuck is Neil
Jfc
The person who interviewed me
who the fuck is he?
I tell you what Neil aint shit
the fuck is he bringing up videogames for
Dude idk
But he did
omfg
(((Neil))) doesnt work for grocery
isnt he Dairy or something?
Fuck if I know, I was being interviewed for new stock check positions though
oh shit
now i know who to blame when some fucking cunt forces an order of several thousand gallons of Ashbeck into my cowshed
More like when 5 quiches don't sell because they weren't reduced correctly for the best before date
and how does one go about incorrectly reducing a quiche?
Hell, if they don't sell they get given to staff apparently
for the most part grocery do reductions
yeah they get given to night workers on sunday
dont believe the hypw
Well apparently they need 2 new workers to work from 5-9 6 days a week, reducing what doesn't sell
Pm
So they can make it so that no food goes to waste
no what we really need are some absolute units to pump those dollies and fucking rumble those shelves
winter is coming
Via autumn
Cheer up love, I might not even get it
oh for fucks sake
youve actually motivated me to get a rail card
so then i can routinely and cheaply travel long distances to come and beat your ass
I'd like to see you try
Also I need to book some driving lessons
So that's gonna be a hole thing
Whole
Ffs
I got an email from Jeremy Corbyn
I didn't realise he knew me
i got an email from Ross Scott
I got a new email app and i can jump from email to email using the volume buttons for some reason
dude thats so sick
ive always wanted my volume buttons to do anything but turn my volume up and down
Hah
It's so nice to have an email app that can detect your device is a phone and then scale the email accordingly
have you tried samsung mail?
Yeah then I switched to outlook
Can't remember why
Maybe it didn't have a unified inbox
I'm using blue mail now
Lol I would have thought Cornyn would be all about red mail xd
AHAHSHSHSHSHHSDHHAHAHAHSHSHSHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Did I fucking stutter?
certainly a ballsy manoeuvre
8.3MB/S PEAK YOU FUCKING PLEBS
hahahahahahahahaha
Shame my disk speed can't keep up
faster than you
haha
fake
and youre willing to stake your reputation on that?
theres a dude from zambia who just moved in paying 20 grand a year just in tuition
why
and he pays extra on accommodation for being Zambian
Dude gave me this
does he still have to pay it as a percentage of his wages above 21 grand or whatever
yeah dude its still a loan
its just a more painful one
a loan that gets cut off at the same point after 30 odd years or so
okay i dont know if i tried plugging my ps3 into the ethernet port yet
if so then that number is literally just for show
somehow that solution completely missed me
and yeah its to keep the blacks out, im sure
you've got a fucking ethernet port
yeah should have mentioned that
who the fuck has a home ethernet port
i know what you should do
get a cheap cisco network switch
configure it as a vtp server
plug it into that port
yeah and then i could try impregnating my dad with a fucking netgear dongle
get real dude
see if your entire network goes down
youre a real bastard arent you
a real bastard who can network
but only computer network
person networking is off the table
you're telling me
nice fire hazard btw
im now making self-deprecating jokes about how antisocial i am to my kitchen buddies
they offered me a spliff-joint
and yeah the cable management scheme was a lost fucking cause
isn't a spliff one of those wooden rods you stir stuff with in chemistry
no thats a stick
you should look into some hacky bluetooth programs and fuck with your fellow party-goers
i keep almost connecting to their bluetooth speakers
would be a shame to blast their room with an alpha-male cumshot compilation PMV
wait until they're playing some music and then pair with the speakers and play a nuclear threat announcement
would that be a crime?
i dont know
not as much a crime as hitting me with a beer pong ball while i try and make a cup of tea but even still
interestingly when i try to do anything relating to the internet with this ethernet cable in the PS shits itself and enters and endless loading screen until i kill it
nice
oh and im sure you coax it into working using your vast networking abilities
this isnt fucking linkedin my man
dude the number of times i've walked into a room or stared at a screen or walked towards a printer and it just starts working again
i extrude functionality
im now going to make the shower work just by walking into it
yeah i turn lights on just by moving my hands
i fixed my internet
On the ps3
?
oh yeah dude
Wtf
i just had to log in
youd be amazed how these technical terms seem to evade me
let me guess
log in to the network
on your ps3
well its complicated
because theres a setup for the setup wifi so you can use the other wifi
but for that you need to sign up to this thing and show physical ID to the uni so you can get an installation wizard
but ignoring that you need to sign up for a whole new thing for the ethernet
for some fucking reason
and i only just figured that out on my laptop having used the ethernet regardless of this
sooo
who's really the regard here?
the uni
what on earth would be wrong with an unrestricted but load-balanced connection that requires no more setup than entering the password from the access point
Sharing
load balanced
as in, everyone gets the same bandwidth
SHARING
STOP FIGHTING
computer 1 gets 8mb/s
computer 2 gets another 8mb/s
that's sharing
Computer 50?
you'd be surprised
well maybe you can give them a network slap or something
Unwarranted sharing
Say, to random visitors
its just a shame that in fixing my internet i managed to break my resolution
random visitors aren't gonna be there all the time
lol my people keep asking to meet you isaac
Dude people are assholes
they think ive had you locked in here
Hah
so i think they think im gay
Yeah I thought they might
my point is if the network has restrictions on access to certain parts of the web
people will always find ways around that shit
including the login bullshit
Sweetcorn
well i certainly couldnt
That was me randomly swiping across my keypad
my ass is sore from the network bumfuck
networking requires an uncomfortable amount of squatting
you need one of those foldable chairs
like on movie sets
it would get caught up in all the cables
and how would i carry it
they fold up you silly bastard
yes
i know
but
in one hand i have 5 three metre long cables all coiled up but about to spring out again
and in the other hand im carrying about 3 or 4 cardboard boxes that may or may not contain stuff
and a toolbox
well a toolbag
with no handles
yeah yeah great thanks
maybe you can hang yourself with it
trouble is im gonna need to reuse those cables
they should invent a cable tie that you can undo
if i were installing the cables it would be good for organisation
in one hand i have 5 three metre long cables all coiled up but about to spring out again
in one hand i have 5 three metre long cables all coiled up but about to spring out again
in one hand i have 5 three metre long cables all coiled up but about to spring out again
what
a cable tie you can undo
is that from your dressing gown
fuck yo
if i were so inclined i would use those
trouble is
i don't carry those on my person all day
and they're a pain
in the ass
oohhh
you could have all the colours of the rainbow
- you faggot
the only reason i would use these before cable ties is because there is a finite amount of cable ties
these take longer to put on
longer to take off
and they're fucking annoying
here i was thinking you were just typing in the matrix all day long
in reality your job is tying up cables
if i had an unlimited number of cable ties then i would totally use them for 5 minute carrying jobs
if only
what if you buy in bulk
then that's a fucking box full of cable ties that takes up room
its not like your buying fucking brain stems
but not for long
that's not what im concerned about
yeah we could buy a new box of cable ties every month
and not bat an eyelid
but what the fuck can you do with a cable tie once you've cut it
send it to landfill that's what
Collect them
and isaac shut up
Hah
oh fuck me next youll be pulling Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley's pubes from your teeth
who the fuck are they
Hairy
OH PICK UP A FUCKING BOOK JAMES
That's who
UNCULTURED PRICK
Yeah I've never heard of them either
Seems like a fairly specific reference

the green party is what happens to labour members when they join the national trust

Go see Bletchley park dickhead
been a while since I've seen Tom up late consistently
hey dude
fuck you
it's a good thing
if you say so
im stil getting up at half 6 everyday
well there you go see
not even harmful
according to my two separate CBT therapists, when you wake up is more important than when you get to sleep
because if you can wake up early consistently then your body will adjust itself
which probably works
it would
if it werent for the fact that i decided to walk to tesco extra at one in the morning
and didnt get back till half two
tbf having a bike wouldn't help for that one
but I fucking *wish* I could go buy food at 1am
having a bike would have cut the duration down fucking significantly
you ever tried balancing bags on a bike?
there's a reason people put baskets on them

what about you Tom?
actually first
remember that big red scab on my chin?
Nope
uhh
no?
good
but
the reason it was so big, was because I had been picking at it
but on top of that
I didn't *get* it
I was squeezing it speculatively a few minutes ago
and good lord my dude
I fucking ***got*** it
youre fucking gross okay
There's a lump at the bottom of my left ear lobe
I know damn well you know what feeling sick and happy at the same time feels like Tom
I think it's a spot under the skin
Sometimes it swells up
what the fuck does that even mean?
ear lobes are difficult
best to just leave them
are you referring to that one time i accidently squeezed my nuts as my body convulsed during a puke sesh and i sort of got a boner?
never ends well
Tom I'm sure there have been plenty of times
only difference is I have a legitimate reason
and that reason is grossness
well
kinda
what?
youre not making any fucking sense
look dude all I know is popping spots feels *good*
Uhhhhhh
If that's what you're into I guess
thank you
i know some people who watch youtube videos of that shit
those people ought to be gassed
oh god
yeah I know it's only good when it's yourself
oohh i see
if it's anyone else, you only get the gross without the relief

I'll give you one fucking guess
Spock
Jean Claude juncker
If your throat hurts have some jelly or ice cream

I don't have either

This old guy walks in and goes to the reception desk and is waiting for service
He locks eyes with me and just stares at me for a good 10 seconds
I'm looking elsewhere because I don't want to stare back but he's definitely just dead set on staring at me
Anyway I flag down a receptionist and ask for my mail
Yeah now imagine my shock when I open my curtain late at night to see what's going on and see a huge black man glaring at me with bright red eyes
Meanwhile he gets served by reception
He says he's here for a meeting with someone
Receptionist asks him if they're expecting him
Which is a standard reasonable question
He basically shouts "Yes of course they are, else I wouldn't be here!" And then loudly mutters "stupid question"
You don't expect that level of unprovoked rudeness here
Well she should have thought about that before doing her job
!quote
Fucking egotist
Pretty sure it was your idea
!quote
Not good
Seriously who pinned that
!quote
That receptionist should have told him to sit down and wait, but not told anyone about it because "obviously they were already expecting him"
If only it were acceptable to be rude back
It so is
Especially passive aggressive
Not from a receptionist in a business centre
They would complain and then the receptionist would have to apologise
Well
Maybe
The MD has his head on straight so it might go better
Right
But then you can do a passive aggressive apology
Trouble is then word gets around from this rude asshat that the reception service at bloxham mill is rubbish
It's better to kill them with kindness or whatever the more apt phrase is
Then globally less assholes appear there
Assholes don't only have assholes for friends
I mean you guys aren't assholes
The people you want to know are the people that understand not to listen to assholes
Idk
Some people are more tolerant than others
I can tolerate someone being rude to me but if they raise their voice I instinctively curl up in a corner and have a panic attack
If Trump told you Taco Bell were rude, what would you think
Never been to taco bell
I don't care what trump says
Trump's an assholr
Because I would think, maybe I would get along with the people at taco bell
Exactly
He's also a politician
Ohhhh
Wait
Trump as a politician is like a child wearing their parents shoes
Nice cat
Thank you
I woke up and went downstairs and he came and sat on me
Is that your brother?
And btw that's the third time Anna asked if you were still here
I think they really wanna meet you dude
No they don't
They might think they do
But they don't
There's a meme to that effect I think
Dude the new AC will be playable on Monday from 1pm if you use a VPN to new zealand
Unfortunately I can't take Tuesday off to play it because my fucking company is at a trade show
Dude the new AC is just the Greek part of the last AC but with dialogue options
It's fucking black flag with a new engine and a ginormous world and dialogue options and more land
Jamie
Que
It's just the Greek part of the last game, with dialogue options, and playable tits
It's set like 400 years before the last game
It'll be fun, because the last one was fun
I'll get it when it's on sale
Otherwise known as when it's value for money
I paid for the gold edition to play it 3 days early
And the season pass
Aka some of the dlc
But not all
Nice job dude
Like it should be
You're really sticking it to the man
I'm voting with my wallet
I like the direction
I'm reading a book called Hyper Capitalism
HOW MUCH DID THAT COST HUH??
Well it was a present to me
So I don't know
Oh boring
It's about our current political and economic climate
Sounds very interesting
And why material values have been systematically and intentionally placed above personal values
To our emotional dismay
And how to avoid living like that
But mainly
It's a comic strip
Don't worry, Martin Luther King Jr. Was the first positive quote
In the entire book
I wouldn't mind having a lot of money
I think that would make me very happy
Because then I would have the resources to be able to do what makes me happy
Well that means you're with the other 80% of your age group
What do the boring 20% say
Dude idk
That was the only simple part of the graph
Point is
It was 40% back in the 60s
Are they the rich people who say "money doesn't buy happiness" while drinking southern comfort from a bucket on the deck of one of their luxury yachts on the coast of monaco
Oh, here's another great statistic
The richest 10% of the American population, hold three quarters of the entire nation's money
Zipf
With the poorest 40% holding under 2% of the money
One in 10 Americans has over 30 times the amount of money all the rest have added together
This is all very zipfy
What does that mean
!define zipf
Fuck
Yeah
Zipf was a person
He came up with Zipf's law
Right
Well he has a dumb name
It's something to do with statistics
Hold on
https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law
Dude
Can't you condense that for me
Yeah doing that
Basically if you took all the words in Wikipedia
And ranked them by frequency
Then the frequency of a specific word would be approximately 1 divided by its rank
Right
But the thing is
That applies to so much more than word frequency
I'm gonna try and put the wealth thing into the equation
Ok
So if you ranked everybody by wealth
Then their wealth could be approximated by 1 divided by their rank
Whatever just watch the vsauce video
With the richest person being 1?
Yep
So their wealth would be 1
Percentage I guess
And the second richest would be 0.5
And it's approximate
Sure
I mean obviously
The second richest person in the world probably has more than half the money of the first
Yeah I need to watch that video again because I'm not quite sure I still understand it
So maybe it's not individual people and rather a range
Yeah idk
I was gonna say the the word consumer surpassed the word civilian in usage back in the 90s
According to Google's collection of textbooks
And is now used more than twice as much
Spider cat
Poes doesn't care about capitalism
He can't even spell C
Been to 4 fucking shops and none of them have any garlic
Dude the coop had crushed garlic remember
It's better than normal garlic

Garlic mince and pasta! Amazing

For someone who literally has 24 hours available to cook every fucking day of the week you sure eat a lot of fucking pizza
Dude I make it once a week
Manually
Literally every pizza I've had recently has been forced on me
Well this is the second meal I've ever cooked
The fact that there is variation alone should earn me some points
Dude make stir fry
Bit fucking late now
It's all in the plan
I just wanted to finish my onions and tatos
I could do with a nap
And a haircut
In that order
So I don't have to interact
Just cut your own hair
Cut my own hair
Genius

I did it once
How did that go
It was pretty good for like a month
Then what happened
I needed a haircut
Just cut your own hair
Exactly
I just saw an advert on the tv for drowning babies

You're two and a half hours late
Oh sorry
I've been planning out the next year
There's no clashes on my timetable but I do have a lecture that starts literally as the other one ends
Which is a solid meme
Fun fun fun
Oh fuck off then
Lol some woman on the local news rightfully complaining about a church looking for a male priest specifically, just said that women are better at being priests than men

I got up 20 minutes ago
And I'm watching two Americans play a free to play game
Sweet as
For some reason we have golf on the TV instead of shitty radio
I don't know whether that's better or worse
What game are your Americans playing
Fucking world of warships
Wow
Yeah
Ha get it
Jfc
Yes
Well done
It was an unconscious effort
Unlike watching this video
Don't watch it then
If its got fucking Americans in it
I moved on
Now I'm watching 3 brits play a wrestling game
Oh lord
Omg the guy just hit a ball near a hole
Didn't go in
But that was amazing!!
Golf is only fun when it's crazy golf
Crazy golf is only fun when there are more than 5 holes and it costs less than £30 per hour
Yes

maybe that can be the name of our second

at least it demonstrates commitment to a theme
Oh that males sense sorry isaac

the wired connection is fine, but the wireless fluctuates between good and off

you should log in to your router and check you have the channel on smart
otherwise try channel 1 6 or 11 i think
since they have the least overlapping with other channels

im looking at the reading list for one of the 12 modules i have this year
each term features like another 3 books
and theyre all like 70 quid
on the other hand, people are flogging them used for literally a pound on amazon
i wonder if you wanted a buzzcut whether you could let hairdressing students practise on your hair and then give you a buzzcut for free
ah yes but are they the 2019 edition
with that pesky full stop they missed on line 71 of page 514
oh no buddy
half of these are taken from theorists who wrote all their shit down and then died in the 80s
and if you want a buzzcut im sure you could pull that off yourself
didn't do them much good then
yeah gotta wonder whos getting all the money
probably the universities they worked for
sounds like a matter of intellectual property
literally
yeah thats why you never do any work at uni
do it all right after
whens your first uni engagement
oh wow, Fairclough 1995 hardcover for 255 pounds?
fuck yeah!
what in sam hill do you mean by engagement?

ok whats up
his xbox wont connect to the internet
has he switched it off and on again
its been a week
which is surprising really
we're pretty sure Lucas and one of the Annas are already fucking
it might well have been a week but some people are real idiots
we can sort of tell from the way he was fingerblasting her under a blanket while everyone was watching a movie
romantic
so has he restarted it
i would literally die if a guy did that to me
idfk dude probably
maybe not
tell him to restart it
maybe he just offered it some fucking weed
i swear
what?
i bet it just needs turning off and on again
at the plug
he worked out to use the ethernet way before i did
so kudos you know

thought so
people arent that bad
someone gave me half a twirl a while back
i still owe that person half a twirl but i cant remember who it was
when everyone is in the same room, look down at your phone and say "thank you for that half a twirl, by the way"
whoever answers
yeah
how the fuck do i get literally everyone in the same room
imagine how cramped and hot it would be
that's your problem not mine
thats a terrible way to solve this issue
i tend to remember people who give me things
does that include people who give you half a twirl
you can answer that by yourself
is half a twirl, a thing?
i still remember when we went to stratford and you gave me a fanta out of the kindness of your heart
you spent a whole pound on me and i never gave it back
and here you still are
if i didn't give you that fanta we might have parted ways by now
that's the true value of our friendship tom
good to know our entire relationship rested on the balance of a cheap fucking fanta

i walked to tesco today and thats like a normal thing to do but my heart was beating really fast and skipping beats
dude its far more reputable than people give it credit for

fuck off normie
if youre going to be ignorant at least be correct
i bet you get all the guys with that line

its a legitimate form of therapy

Make burgers
whats the extent of your cooking ability you prick
i can make toast
oh
well i actually can't
lol

!define blitzed
I feel like blitzed would be a relatively harsh word if you were high
bit too percussive
but I am fucking blitzed rn
I'm gonna feel it tomorrow
in my bones
well probably more likely to be my muscles but
sounds better if you say "in my bones"
so says The Killers
i wonder how your water tastes
this is exactly like when people started using 🇧 instead of g and i had no fucking clue what was happening so just nodded and smiled
This is one of the people accused of poisoning that spy in Salisbury, Russia did a tv interview with them making them out to be civilian tourists, and they were just visiting Salisbury because their friends had told them what a wonderful city it is
so great they went twice?
He's since been confirmed as a Russian soldier
Well the second poisoning is from the same exact batch, basically they were unlucky enough to pick up the bottle the Russians discarded
this doesnt sound like news
Yeah it's not it's like 3 months old
Where have you been
no i just meant its not interesting or important
I have two things to be excited about today
First of all the new assassins creed game
But secondly
And mainly

Juggling
Those were the dayz
If only I still had 3 balls
Still waiting bitch
My skillz they would amaze
One cloudy day I was juggling
A ball fell on the floor
It split open, spewing its contents
So I can't juggle no more
Wow
I'd put that on my wall but I'm not allowed
Sing that to the tune of Firestarter by the prodigy

Hah Holy shit
So what did you do today jamie
Oh you know
Rebooted the entire phone system
Well I will have done if this comes back up
Lol nobody's phones are working in the whole building
And the best part
It's not our fault
Priorities
1st of October boys
Only got 30 days to plan your sexy Halloween costumes
Jabba the hut in a mankini
Honestly trust a site wide issue to hold me back from going home on the day assassins creed comes out
I thought it came out on the 5th
It does
Gold edition early access on the 2nd
Local release on uplay means I can VPN to new zealand and play it today
Gross
If you say so
Gotta outsource to New Zealand to get your fix
Should be buying local man
Well it's already downloaded
It just unlocks in new zealand first
Also I have a flute
Or will have
Awesome sauce
weed guy offered me weed so i can fix my toe

We had weird pizza

Pepper, sausage and sour cream
man that is one weird fuckin pizza
Pretty good though

Libby just put a crisp packet in the microwave
what happened then
It sparked
Then shrunk
It's kind of cool
Don't make a habit of doing that
It will damage the microwave
Just saying
You don't really want that on your expenses
God this is a drag
Wouldn't it be funny if I quit right now
While the phone system is fucked
I could bring down this entire business park
What happened to giving notice
Too late
I fixed it
I am now a saint
What did you do at work today jamie
Oh you know
Single handedly brought the entire building's phone system back up
!news
Oh you fucking cunt
!news
God fucking dammit leslie
I'm calling the bot leslie btw
!news
Hahaha hell
Whaaaaat
Check the email address
It can't be that easy
Obviously not I'd have to proof I'm a business
The point is that I wasn't lying when I said I'm very almost literally broke
Still I mean you could make a limited company pretty easily
As long as you don't make any profit then I don't think you have to pay any corporation tax
And then buy vat exempt stuff
I always thought that stood for very Asian turds
Bullshit
!define vat
The people have spoken
There's something weird about having a YouTube video suggested to you where the people are reviewing a piano keyboard but they work at a shop and they have the shop's phone number in the description and it has 01295 as the area code
Now that I think about it it might have something to do with me basically allowing google to access all my data
You may as well tell a stranger in the street that you're not into coons
Google's not interested in that
Ohoho
Isn't it
I'm happy to sell my soul to Google because I trust them not to sell it on
Opens up more functions on my phone
You might have heard of the whole internet of things lark
Facebook on the other hand
God no
Anyway I can probably call up google and tell them to erase all my data if I needed to
And they'd have to
Otherwise they'd have to pay me quite a lot of money
I got the aux mothafuckas
I hope you get told off
Weed just work up because they're testing the fire alarm
He missed all 3 of his first lectures
And might have shit the bes
BED
I SAID BED
OH PLEASE GOD FORGIVE ME
You're just calling him Weed now
Nice
If I knew his name I'd use that
What do they call you
What's your nickname
If he had any personality traits I might have used one of those
Oh well according to the chat Lucas is Lord God Emperor
And I'm T-Dog
Oh god one of those
I chat to someone on steam who demands to be addressed as a god
It's really FUNNY HAHA :+1:
Yeah he and Anna think they're in love
He sits in the kitchen because he needs a constant stream of social interaction or else he'll die
God I wish I were like that
You don't
He laughs at everything I say as if it's a really funny joke
That's because it usually is
He constantly smiles without any fucking reason
Nice
Happy guy
He must suffer serious lockjaw
He also stretches in the kitchen before he goes on a run so that you know he's going on a run
I usually say, 'Hey Lord God Emperor, going on a run?'
And he responds 'Ye'
I'm glad I'm not the only one who sees things like that
I think I prefer The Big Weed because all he does is offer me free drugs
Everyone sees it they're just too polite to say fuck off you're making the kitchen smell of gay sweat
Is anyone you know there
Well
You know them now
But like
Is anyone from the warriner going to the same uni
Felix Clarke is here
Neighbours forever
He took a gap year travelling Europe on daddy's money
No he's in the expensive accomadation with catering a shitter in the cell with you
He's doing zoooolology
Wow really
What fucking great prospects that offers
Yeah I'm entertained by people who take very expensive courses to get qualifications that you could get through an apprenticeship
Only that would give you both money and work experience
Half the people at any university have fallen victim to the fallacy that you have to go to uni to get anywhere in lifr
I made that statistic up but you get the point
Half the people go to uni
Not as exclusive as it use to be
Not as encouraged either
There were about 20 of us in one of my language modules
On the core literature one we filled a lecture theatre for like 250 people
I said I wanted to quit and do an apprenticeship and Fuckingham said ok
Yeah
She was strange
10 years ago it would have been why on earth do you want to do that you delinquent child
I think k it probably depended on your background
Although 10 years ago university would've been £9k for 3 years
Not that that made any difference I'm sure
When I'm president I'll replace tuition fees with academic contribution
Lol tfw you give permission for the elite universities to raise their prices but all the shitty ones do it too
Thing is they're only getting that extra money from the idiots who pay it all upfront
While alienating a chunk of more sensible candidates
No I disagree with the concept of buy-your-own-education
Yeah even more entertaining is that despite the 12 grand I'm paying to live and learn here I'm still being hit with 'COMPULSORY Consent Class'
And I'm told that if I miss more than one lecture I will be thrown off the course
What about Weed
Oh and they can come and inspect my room at any time without warning
Uhh you should look into that
That's definitely not legal
Even if you signed it
The Big Weed attennded but wasn't fully conscious
No I know
It still wouldn't be legally binding
They never did show up though
They're not coming in in the event they do tbh
But the point is they say they can
Yeah a lot of this is to scare us into being good little boys
But I still throw my banana peels into the recycling bin
So that's how they make banana cakes
We don't have a landfill container at bloxham mill
My lecturer today insisting on using Cortana For litwrally everything
Everything either goes in the recycling or left with reception for them to hire a company to pick up our landfill
Oh fuck
That's awful
First thing I switch off when setting up any laptop
Because it's the first thing that shows up
Yeah it was like watching my grandmother try to use twitter
My grandmother uses pinterest
And so does my mum
Pinterest is for old woman and my porn collection
I didn't know you were into that
Yes I'm into porn
Of old woman?
Ew no gross
Dude the sociopaths are everywhere
Be warned, they'll rape and won't even feel good about it
Dude what if I'm a sociopath
Oh shit what if someone I know is a sociopath
Plot twist
I think I'm a sociopath
Everyone's a sociopath
But I don't want to be
Except from the people who have been diagnosed
Well here's an easy test
Go on live leak
If you're repulsed, you're fucking fine
I'm not doing that at work
I'm watching Shane Dawson do his little documentary
I might lose my job and stop getting money
And he keeps making these faces like this is all news
A psychologist just told him one in 25 people are sociopaths
Shane Dawson is so 2007
And he's sat there thinking 'oh no they're coming for my little faggot ass'
hes got this dank horror music playing
'this person has a lack of empthay? oh well obviously theyre going to kill everyone'
I never watched any of his shit but the small amount I did see I could swear he wasn't talking like he does now
'oh this person doesnt get upset when someone kicks a dog? im so scared theyll manipulate me into thinking they feel emotion'
yeah i feel like he must be putting it on
Have you watched Killing Eve yet
i won't go so far as to call him a sociopath buuuut
no
You should
i really want to watch more people playing armchair psychologist
It's very psychopath oriented
but its also really fucking annoying
its like when someone is told a horrifying statistic, like one in one people will rape them
That's a pretty horrifying statistic
Give them credit
and despite the fact that they've never been raped and that they've seen no evidence or validation for the statistic they start being like 'oh no not my gay asshole'
hes literally sat on a sofa clutching his pillow and he looks like hes going to cry
im pretty sure sam is a sociopath
fits the bill pretty fucking well with the intelligence, obvious lack of empathy and the way he acts completely different in front of different people
on the other hand hes never raped or murdered me and is clearly not a threat to anyone
also still pretty much just a human being
OH BUT FUCK ME NOT PSYCHOLOGY BUZZ WORDS
WAAAAH!
Well that's the difference between a sociopath and a psychopath isn't it?
One of them is violent
Please correct me I'm interested
yeah psychopaths are worrying
but they're far more rare
they tend to actually enjoy watching people suffer
sociopaths just have a lack of feeling either way
people don't seem to be able to make the distinction between school shooters and people who are just mimicking being normal so that they can get on with their lives
like the idea that maybe someone is lying is the worst thing in the world, and I really don't get why
its as though just because someone isnt the exact same as you its a big problem
kinda like that one guy i saw online saying the only reason he wanted his son circumcised was so that he wouldnt be different to him
or how some people think niggers are bad
Here we go
Circumcision
exactly the same situation
although circumcision is more of a threat to society that sociopathy
You know I think someone mentioned that denmark was looking to ban it
i dont want to see 'The Mind of Jake Paul: is he a sociopath'
i want to see 'The Fleshy penis of Jake Paul: has he retained the duvet?'
Is that even a question
yeah iceland did that and people the other of the world were all like 'oh no you cant do that, it offends my religion that youre not cutting up little boys penises to appease my imaginary god'
Of course he's a sociopath
yeah i mean you dont even necessarily need to establish that
i think its pretty obvious that he isnt a serial killer either
just that he does shitty things sometimes
Who else the fuck goes and films a hanging corpse in the woods and makes jokes about it and then goes home and spends probably quite some time putting it all together and editing and knowinf itll get taken down but still doing it just for that extra viral-ness
that was the other one
its not complete proof, but yeah its still pretty obvious
it might have traumatised a few kids but he didnt put the corpse there as far as we know
And then tweeting an apology and giving yourself a nice holiday break so he can think about what he's done and how horrible he is while probably drinking beer and catching up on netflix
i just dont get the hype
had he filmed a snuff film then yeah i might also be a bit miffed
I don't mean to accuse him of killing the dude
i guess i just really dont get why it worries people to such a great extent
I mean who films a dead guy who committed suicide and then jokes about it, edits it in, and uploads it to a YouTube channel watched by minors
like the psychologist gives an example
There were so many exit points to that process
theres an old woman crosses the street and some people will be like, oh okay shes going to be walking slow thats fine
but the dreaded evil sociopath will be like 'ugh hurry up i have places to be'
then shane dramatically looks at the camera with those red eyes and mouth gaping open as though its waiting for his gay lovers cock to intrude again, and we're supposed to sit there listening to the horror flick music thinking 'oh my god he might as well have fucked my dog with a crowbar'
Oh my god you know what grinds my goat
Jesus Christ
Get a fucking room
fuck off isaac
if youre not here to agree you can go kill yourself
EPIC SOCIOPATHY
FREAR ME
do you remember zaptie
poor guy is best friends with 3 other youtubers and they have one of the most popular podcasts on youtube together
Those interviews where they have a normal camera filming you looking off at slight angle, but then another camera that films a close up of your hands or just another angle of your face, and they cut to it every now and then
DONT DO THAT FUCJ
they're all clearly very good friends even outside of the youtube scene
!define ostensibly
it lasts a very long time and they have some very big guests, and although they disagree on some topics they always get along and always nice to each
but then one day, a big bad rumour that zaptie *MIGHT* be a sociopath comes along
and now the podcast has to be shut down, and no one is allowed to talk to zaptie and everyone should unsubscribe from his channel
of course its bullshit and hes not a sociopath
but the point is who could give a fuck?
he was still clearly very good friends with those people
My feet hurt
and even if he was only nice to them in an attempt to get some reward from them later down the line it really didnt differentiate very much from a real relationship someone might have
but apparantly by voicing an alternate opinion or sympathising with him, i must also fall into the one in 25 people who are sociopaths
I think most people turn into sociopaths on the internet
Which in a way means most people are sociopaths but they have their priorities in a different place
well maybe introjection and the lack of the usual social input to their senses allows them to act differently or more 'freely'
or maybe people should stop analysing every fucking thing someone does or says and just catergorise people as either good or shitty
What about politicians
Good in some people's eyes
Bad in others
yeah
thats fine
Yeah actually I suppose it is
no need for a documentary, sad music and footage of a plane crash
aw dude i wasnt very exciting to move to uni
shit bois
you cant be my freinds because im a sociopath
Sociopaths can have friends
Well
People who are friends with them
jesus christ dude are you sympathising with 'them'
you must be one of 'them'
I can't tell
I have feelings but I rarely act on them
im currently sat here clutching my pillow in the foetal position because im just fucking scared
dude one in 25 means someone in this building must be one
what if they ask me how my day has been... *but they actually don't care*
thats fucking terrifying
oh wait, literally fucking everyone does that
aw dude its the human condition
you ever heard something so fucking cynical
naah even better we're born in sin and have the slimmest chances of redemption
basically never have any pleasures, live only in service of other people who probably hate you as much as you hate them, and then fucking die and suffer like you deserve you piece of shit
oh no
if they go to therapy they get better at acting normal
oh no
15% of one in 25 could potentially be dangerous
(although we won't define dangerous)
😱
okay
dude
i dont want to freak you out
but you're cat is like 99% for sure a fucking sociopath
I've been doing a support call over email today instead of going to the office
It's taking much longer
sleep with your eyes open, and your ass clamped
But I'm doing over email because
I don't know how to pronounce their name
How do you say Catrin
I mean it probably comes from Katrina
But
CA-trin
ca-TRIN
ca-TREEN
Idk wtf
Why can't everyone be called mike
that would certainly make things easier for us sociopaths who don't care what your name is
Hah
ew interracial
No I think they were just wearing that color suits
Wanna hear my shopping list
would it affect whether you told us
Potentially
then yes please
Milk, bread and painkillers
just the essentials
Exactly
keep alluding to the pain you're in and i might eventually get round to pretending to care
(I'm a sociopath none of my behaviour is genuine)
i bet you didn't even really send those messages
Sam says people are just bad algorithms and that one day we will replace our brains with AI
!define yikes
hah
an example of a sociopath overselling his point in order win your trust
so he can *manipulate you from the inside!*
I'm imagining like a WW2 propaganda poster with that on
yeah i might use that a bit too often
one of my kitchen buddies pointed to someone who was apparently 'checking me out' the other night and i responded with 'yikes'
i guess they thought i was repulsed by the person
but thats actually just what i say all the time
hahah
yeah
and when confronted with a situation where youve accidently embarrassed yourself the only responsible response is 'yikes'
"oh no, something has happened"
i think i wanted to start swearing less
so i started firing blimeys
I guess that's respectable
and spouting crikeys
and then i dropped a few yikes and thats just so 'me' ya know
must encourage empathy from others
!define insidious
you ever seen the red pill?
I can't say I have
ahh you're a fucking prick
get red-pilled you ignorant
I mean, seems like a matrix reference
or just drugs
no its a reference
i mean maybe its drugs and im just missing out
but its a matrix reference
I've read some of the book titled "Taking the red pill"
yeah thats gay
watch the documentary
it was an alright book
the goddamn documentary
dude I'm not watching some hip fucking documentary
its not fucking hip you asshole
im not watching it because it gets 20% on rotten tomatoes and a 7. something on IMDB
im watching it because im woke
I watched the second episode of Iron Fist
theres some pretty funny stories in here man
this one dude was stabbed by his wife
so they sent him to jail
is this gonna be another meninism thing
naaaah cos we should only listen to one side of every argument
im not about to argue that we should be reallocating resources and funding to men and that women should have less
im saying that adjusted wage gap figures show the true gap to be <5%
and im sick of having all sorts of conversations with people here about how that since im a white male im fucking set
naaaaah meninism is a gay thing
fuck you faggot
until it happens to me, it's not happening
lol you think any man is comfortable talking about these experiences
theres this one gay being regularly sexually and violently abused by this one woman
so he goes to the authorities and since there isnt enough evidence they basically tell him he has to be careful because if she so much as breaks a fingernail against him he'll go to prison
GUY
i dont hate the homos
i just dont think they're really human
like sociopaths
women are sociopaths okay
lol theres no domestic violence shelters for men
i lie
theres actually one
hehe
dude just take the fucking pill
you're so boring rn
unless that pill is lsd then I'm not interested
oh okay
keep watching iron fist you ignorant fuck
hahaha the woman who set up the only mens shelter is barred from entering her own female shelter
cos shes just too fucking dangerous
despite being in her 70s
she helps male victims therefore shes basically a dude therefore shes going to put her spiky dick in woman pussy and beat them
why is my laptops network so slow
I'm pretty sure it's the laptop's fault

Que
that is the main piece of religious rhetoric for justifying circumcision
its apparently an act of respecting a covenant between Abraham and god
the bargain was the Abraham would be fertile, but would have to offer the foreskin of every man within his dynasty, and all of those in subjugated dynasties
this has been criticised even by members of the jewish and islamic faith as a ridiculous commitment to an outdated text and only demonstrates devotion to a primitive form of religion
but the thing is i can sometimes see reason behind what might look like a silly ideal or rule for a religion to have
I'm stuck in my game
like if you knew STIs were spread through sex then perhaps staying monogamous or abstaining until marriage might make sense
but even the modern day 'compelling' evidence for the health benefits of circumcision is derived from studies with small and unvaried sample groups in which much of the methodology behind data collection is hidden, and of these im sure a large number suffer from confirmation bias
the most valid argument i can find is that it is cleaner
but if you cant clean your tool then maybe you shouldnt be playing with it in the first place
It's like I need to find the right shape for the hole
But it's only giving squares
did you know that according to some religions deriving from Abrahamic texts that you cant consider children to be your own if they are uncircumcised?
in many cases the mother isnt even allowed to be present to comfort the child
i can only imagine that if western psychology has found such a strong fascination on the penis and its fragility in both men and women, the idea of this happening at a later stage in which the child is more conscious must be fucking traumatic
poor little 6 year olds being told their dicks are going to be cut up in the name of a malignant god who doesnt even have the decency to offer any reason behind their demand
So what are you gonna do about it
well in the event i have children im going to be very fucking knowledgeable about the facts
i understand that your point is my whinging is pathetic and really doesnt mean anything
but im not micro influencer isaac
i really fucking wish i could do something
but im not really happy about it either way
Alright
You know what I want
hey maybe this means im not a sociopath
look at me caring about sociopolitical issues occuring on different continents
did you know in france you can be awarded jail time if you get a DNA test as a father to see whether a child is actually your's or not
you need express written permission from the mother
Tom I don't care
i know
I have enough stuff to be depressed about
I don't have time to find France depressing also
you could try being miffed instead
I could
Later
youre a real fucking buzzkill
Help me connect emotionally to a fictional robot
So I can help out a different fictional robot
To find their fictional body
I care far less about that than i do about poor ishmeal having his genitals mutilated for no earthly reason
Yeah but you might actually be able to do something about this
look prickhead, ive come to a site of education thats drawn people looking to develop intellectually not just from all over the UK but also from a variety of other countries
most of whom are of a similar age to me and are still developing not just biologically and mentally, but also in terms of personal identity
the next time one of the calls me a misogynistic pig for bringing up male rights as though its somehow an act that diminishes the rights of females, I'll be able to support whatever I have to say with data and logical arguments
and im more than happy to vent both my frustrations and musings in my own chat so aptly titled 'bigfoot is real and he tried to eat my ass'
and i dont subscribe to this 'people never change fucking bollocks'
because its bollocks
It really is a hard puzzle
so is finding a way to gently break apart a deeply ingrained world view so that other may see both sides of an argument with an open mind
but thats why i rake red fucking pills
I would settle for anything
that sounds about right
Oh
My
God
Anne Marie is playing in Reading on my birthday next year
Who's that
Woah I can swipe through the predictive text options
'Who's that'
Wash your soap out with mouth boy
Sorry I don't listen to trash
No you exclusively listen to radiohead
Which is just hip trash
Everybody must leave the room
As it is
With everybody in it
What?
Sorry you got your mucking words fuddled up and it reminded me of a monty Python sketch involving detective inspector Lookout of the yard
And chief constable there's a man behind you
You're like an encyclopedia of shit
Aduce me to introlow myself
Go on then
I'm det. insp. Tiger of the Yard
And then you say "Tiger?!"
And I say "where?!"
That's not funny
You have to watch the sketch
There's another layer

Dude that uni of greenwich thing
You realise what that means
You can nick any book from there and when they see the stamp and tell you it's stolen you can just say you bought it second hand
This is the perfect crime
Wanna plan a raid?
Of a probably free library?
Reading library is supposed to be one building
It's currently two
Isaac you can steal books from libraries
You just don't bring them back
And you don't let them stamp your library card
https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4kq13k/3_guys_are_hiking_through_the_woods_when_they/
Lol one of my lecturers does this thing where they set up a poll for students to answer and then broadcast the results on the massive screen at the front
The question 'what skill have you brought to uni' came up
And I was all like 'can cook minute rice in 58 seconds'
And that showed up did it
Yes
What was the general reaction
Giggles
Jack was amused up until he realised he's stuck with a 20 year old Nokia brick with an actual keypad
I'd love a brick
no youre a basic android hipster
when you can grow a beard as fearsome as Jack's then you can strive for a new level of hip

You've done enough damage friend
Do you know what the worst dilemma is
The worst dilemma ever in the whole world times a thousand bagsy no returns
did you receive a fucking train to the back of the head and mentally digress 20 years?
The worst dilemma is deciding whether to have your lunch at 1pm or 2pm
Do you get fooded sooner and be less hungry
But have a much longer afternoon
I take mine at 3
Or so you put food into yourself later
But then I don't work
And have a much much shorter afternoon
3pm is basically 5:30pm
Yeah but it's still a ways of 8pm
But I don't have to be at work then
This sounds like a you problem

You make a better one then Mr university student
I'm making music rn asshole
Ohh dude gimme a listen
I'm learning the flute
I don't even think my flute is in tune
You don't want a listen
I'm using an app called soundtrap
And how is your flute not in tune?
It was only £150
Have you tried tuning it?
HOW DO YOU TUNE A FLUTE
Wow you really are an amateur
I didn't realise but flutes are really fucking expensive
Mine is a super shit range one
I don't think you're very good with momey
If you wanted a good one you'd have to pay about 2 grand
MONEY
Bit of a Freudian slip there
Dude I don't need to be right now
I don't have a car
I don't even have to pay tax
I'm on my way to 5 figures just from not buying shit for like a year
I had 5 figures once
How did it feel
Like 2 whole hours of financial security
I could buy a really really shit dirt house with my savings
I want to avoid renting
You should look on the market in stock for the cheapest houses
When you've got a minute
I know how ridiculously expensive they are
Anyway I'd need at least 25 grand to get a mortgage
Stoke
Not stock
They're not expensive
Stoke
Why would I want to live up north
Eugh
You wouldn't, that's the point
I don't know why the houses in holiday places are so cheap
Ive often thought about living nearer the coast
I'm pretty near the coast
You're in reading dude not Bournemouth
Then explain why seagulls keep trying to shit on me
They can smell you from bournemouth
If I did get a mortgage I'd also have to sort out bloody water gas electric shit
And insurance
And probably have a car as well
Fucking why can't I just install the driving ability as a software upgradr
It costs me 17 pounds a day to live in this room
Is that good or bad in the grand scheme of things
Well these compulsory consent classes are costing me far more
It sort of balances out I guess
I need a full time job in walking distance of my home
That pays about 50 grand please
And I need to learn about how music does before I try with this shit
Major and minor scale
Start with those
Are you giving me fucking assignments now
I could just take a music module while I'm here
Or even just join a society that does this kind of thing
Please do that
Haha why
We could have jam sessions
I'm not looking to learn an instrument
I recommend the harmonica
Really easy
Just think a note and it comes out
That's the kind of thing I'd expect Weedio to say
Does Weed play an instrument
Apart from his blunt
Um
He tried to play the guitar but had to do some weed before he started learning
There's the two homeless dudes who I nod at whenever I walk past them on Christchurch road
They take turns with a heroin needle in the phone booth there
That sounds
Sterile
Reading has a big drug problem
This app is free
It should go to rehab then
And it allows you to collab with other people on your tracks
You can even just record shit on an instrument and use that
I'm wiring up my bedroom into a recording studio and I'm not collaborating with anyone
Oh
Because the first half of that sounded like we were really going somewhere
Well I was doing that then assassins creed came out
Well I mean you're welcome to come and play some shit
Hahaha
I can't do that
I don't know how it's gonna work though
I need a unidirectional dynamic microphone for my guitar amp
You should meet Will Palmer
I think you'd really connect
Who's that then
The lead guitarist of Endercast
Oh great
He also happens to work at Tesco
He can do guitar pretty good though
Probably better than me
Oh and he's also a complete piece if shit
I mean
Yeah most musical people are
Did You listen to any of their tracks?
No
Yeah they're not the next Quinton
Wow
I don't even know what Quinton is
So that's saying something
I just made it u
P
Fuck
First time he performed on stage his E string exploded and he hadn't brought a backup guitar
So he played like that for the rest of the night
There's a video on YouTube of BB King playing a guitar solo and one of his strings breaks
He restrings it while still playing
What an idiot
I'm not very good at this
I keep looping what I've already dine to see where I can add to it or transition into something else but after the 100th time it starts to sound like shit
Just do something completely different
Suddenly
What like go outside
No I mean musically
Change key idk
Go up by a diminished 5th
It would help if I understood what any of this was
That'll sound interesting
I'm going in completely blind
Is there a piano keyboard
Yeah
You can download it on your phone if you want
Just move everything up 7 keys
Including black keys
And do the exact same
Trying to figure out chords as well
You should learn scales first it'll help
Last night I was doing some wild EDM shit and overloaded my cpu
Wow nice
If there's nothing interesting I'll take a music module next term
Otherwise I might try learning an instrument after christmas
Or joining a society idfk
You could join one
I'm probably gonna get a ukulululu at some point
Shit you can have mine
I'm not using it kek
Nah I want a good one
Nigger fuck you
Music societies are meh to me at the moment
I want to see what I can do out of my own head
Look where that got me
I feel like making a 19 minute long world music composition with polyrhythms and time signatures that change based on how many minutes through the song it is
With modal interchange
I feel like chords are bullshit and I should just draw a smiley face
Scales dude
It'll click
That's a point
Percussion
Percussion is coming next
Don't you worry
I haven't got anything to do percussion with
I need an electronic drumkit
So play your music and then import it to this app and then add in drums
I don't know what the best order is to do stuff in but drums last seems a bit odd
Well there's only two fucking instruments
Add more
Just play the same thing on a different instrument
Idk
Jesus have you thought about tutoring
No dude I'm just bursting at the seams to do this myself
But assassins creed comes first
Do it at work
No one will know
They're all on a bus ride to Swansea

Oh hi Isaac
I've never eaten Chinese food
K
You ever had rice?
Rice can't be considered exclusively chinky
Exclusively oriental
Not even that
But even then that would have missed the point
I'm not talking Chinese food from 1000 years ago
I'm talking modern day cultural Chinese food
Stop being a pedantic prick
Still a lot of rice
This is why I'm your only friend
I'm ordering some rn
And what does that even make Jamie
Holy fuck look
An authentic chink dish!
Guess I don't even have to cook tonight
Dude tell me that it doesn't say Chinese somewhere on the packet
Or China
Right
Hold the fucking phone
Some of that came out really blurry but the point it fucking doesn't
It says TESCO ON IT
The well known Chinese food
Just go fuck yourself
Yeah the most important side is the blurriest
I am telling you right ducking now it doesn't mention Chinese anything
"Produce of more than one country" yeah alright Tesco, way to dodge the question
Fuck off isaac
It's grows all over Asia AND africa
African rice
Didn't know that
HMM I WONDER IF AFRICAN RICE IS RICE
Is it black?
Naaah too many coincidences
Hey dude it's masturbate tomorrow
Well it fucking would have been
BUT I DON'T FUCKING EAT  CHINKY
You've never had a stir fry?
Not one following a tradition fucking Chinese recipe
And definitely not made by a chink
And fucking definitely not one provided by a fucking Chinese takeaway
Dude the way you're describing it makes it seem like there is no Chinese food
And guess what bitch
In that context Chinese is basically a metanym of Chinese takeaway
Which I'll have you know I don't fucking eat
GODDAMNIT
How about you eat my cock?
It's not in the slightest bit Chinese
No fucking rice involved
Well
Just my fleshy cock
Oh what the fuck
It might be slightly Chinese
No you tell how my penis is fucking chinese
Well, bare with me
Oh I can already tell this is going to be a fucking stretch
You just can't stand being wrong

I apologise if my constant opening and closing of Europa Universalis is irritating but I happen to be a save summing piece of shit with no legitimate claim to the achievements I have this far acquired in the game
THUS
I SAID THUS
i've seen much worse
couple of people on my friends list used to use some kind of achievement getter
literally opened and closed every game in their library like 50 times each in a matter of minutes
I don't know why I play iron man tbh
I could just load
But no I'm sure you think of me as an alpha because I have the 'open the game' achievement
for fucks sake
im playing as France in the 1444 start
so the war of roses is about to go down and England has no feasible way of defending their French territories
so i forge an alliance with castille and marry into scotland to bolster my allies to ensure the Burgundy doesn't consider me an easy target
this allows me to move into Normandy and Aquitaine with relative ease
why did you tell me to play AC at 12:28
but thats not enough for England to concede all their continental counties
wasn't i playing AC at the time
apparently not
then i had probably just stopped for lunch
although im not playing it now either
so now i have to send over troops to Scotland for an amphibious invasion, dodging the fucking ridiculous british navy as i go
i manage to stack maybe 30,000 men and take northumberland, but just as im mopping up the last english troops, burgundy decides to make its move against provence, with whom i apparently had an alliance with
this draws me into a ridiculous situation where burgundy is trying to take my provinces by considering me a co-belligerent in their fight against provence, which in turn allows me to call in my spanish allies
but because Burgundy is allied with genoa who are allied with the papal state, i am excommunicated, drawing half of the fucking Holy Roman Empire into the war
because of some backwards fucking deal England had, theyre now also involved in the war, but on my side
basically europe has erupted into some kind of retarded renaissance era world war
its only getting worse because if i play long enough the bloody ottomans consider me a rival for american territories
i literally get nothing out of this but semen in my asshole
Again
yeah im about to give it another shot
everything rests on this one province in east france as thats the war goal
we're seriously outnumbered but theyve made no effort to consolidate their forces
but that just means i have to move my rape stack up and down France like a complete twat staving off anyone who might think taking anjou to form a pincer attack would be a wise idea
some asshole duke actually managed to sack Paris last time with only a thousand bods
theres no way i can leave this alliance with provence either because that kind of backstab would completely destabilise the realm and the fucking bourgiose would take the opportunity to start an uprising in Berry

except that's when Resident Evil 2 remake comes out
or you won't
so not even then
but even if you don't remember
I'll probably remember
you'll make a remark out of pure rage in this chat
I'll tell you what was hardcore, fighting anubis 5 levels under recommended
that shit sucked
fucking hyenas man
those trials things are eeeasy
they're mechanical
what the anubis fight?
try it when you get two shot
oh fair
ok
i was already max level when they came out
it might not have been so bad if the dodge was better
they went for dark souls-ish combat
oh yeah you could only dodge like twice
but not an invincibility frame dodge
i think dodging is unlimited in this one
it was just too slow
you didn't travel far enough to avoid the attack
there's no shield in the new one so you have to dodge or parry
it fucks you up
I mainly dodged anyway
blocking is for the concerned
I don't like the look of either of the protagonist options
they both kinda look
normal
i recommend the woman
the dude looked too goofy
dude looked like a fucking Hobbit extra
and kassandra's VO is brilliant
her name is kassandra
ugh
better than alexios
I mean
alexios sounds greek
so does kassandra wtf
kassandra sounds roman
!define kassandra
dude
never do names
of course
sorry
I'll look it up
more to the point
prevalent female warrior character in a well known game franchise is called Cassandra
I guess I'm just more into names like Bayek and Ezio
EZIO AUDITORE DA FIRENZE
rolls right off the tongue
yeah it actually does
what's her surname
uhhhh
did they have surnames in ancient greece
she's probably just kassandra of somewhere
wonderful
how efficient
not gonna wiki it in case spoilers
fine
well Kassandra is a greek name
funny that
and the second half of it means 'man'
nice
what does the first half mean
to excel or shine
shiny man
nice
totally
"Shining upon men" is another interpretation
kinda weird though
this some SJW bullshit
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
no
meant
/s
because
que
unlike some people
weatever
im digging a hole
yeah wtf
i dont really know what point i was trying to make
can't be that important then
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
apparently tomorrow is thom yorke's 50th birthday
wunderbar
is it not then?
well
i trust the people on the radiohead subreddit to get his birthday right
you gonna celebrate?
im gonna celebrate tomorrow by playing paranoid android on my flute
as if i can play anything more than mary had a little lamb
and that takes 5 minutes
and i have to look at a chart
flutes are heavy yo
do you even lift (flutes) bruh
I'm starting to think my internet problems might not be my laptops fault
I think my brother castrated my router
so that literally only he gets good wi-fi
so that's fun
does Nat know his networking stuff
about as much as me I imagine
except he has the password to the BT account
if you're concerned just wait till he's out and hit the reset button
it's not even that
he split the router into two wi-fi signals
each with a different bandwidth
is one of them 5GHz
but only he can see the better one
if he's split it into 2.4GHz and 5GHz that's normal
some devices respond better to each
well I'd like to be on the 5ghz
no you want to be on the 2.4
wtf
whatever
5GHz is higher frequency so lower wavelength, so it's easier blocked by walls and shit
the problems only started when he did it
so I can only assume it *is* the problem
that's a setting on the router anyway you could just reset it
how
there's probably a little reset button on the back
just hold it down for a few seconds i imagine
it'll go to factory defaults so if you changed the wifi password
it'll go back to default
alright, well I guess it still doesn't explain why my phone works fine in my room
i think most phones prefer 5GHz
i forgot to go to bed
and now it's 2 hours later
bye

Look at these fucking nerds doing nerd banter hope they get nerd cancer
why dont you trust me tim
this is a serious issue that we need to address

No
But it was my favorite bowl
So I'd like another
Boy bikes are hard apparently
Aaaaand Jamie's back
uh no im just back now
Yeah that's what I said
4 minutes ago
when i wasn't back
Look Jamie, we were both watching doctor who
If anything me being wrong means you were tardy
had to pause a couple times
Everyone keeps telling me I got a haircut
I don't know why
But I'm going to start locking my door at night
There's more blood on my sheets
nice
I'm fucking scared Jamie
It could have been spliff
It could have been Mulenga Mulenga
is it new blood?
Obu Obu Obu
Holy shit it could have been Lloyd thought I was a sheep
Yes it's new I washed the last lot off
it's you dude
you're bleeding on your sheet in the night
Yeah because he bumraped my freshly shaven arsehile
ARSEHOLE
GODDAMNIT
My back tends to bleed
In bed I mean
mine doesn't
i have a diversity officer
aw dude Hila got Ethan pregnant
why the fuck does windows defender alert me that it has found 0 threats
Congratulations?
well yeah
it's my only AV
i don't am stupid so i don't get viruses
but i don't need an alert to say there's nothing wrong
well I've deducted that my crappy wi-fi is due to my room's location
the question now is why is this only a recent development
has your room moved in the past few weeks?
no
it actually never has
I've always slept in this room
well we can rule out earthquake
oh
I can only assume my wifi signal is weaker in general
but even that is strange
BT is punishing you for your liberal mindset
*conspiracy*
my nose is simultaneously wet and dry
this is infuriating
hey Tom
for fucks sake isaac
this better not be homoerotic in any fucking way
I like Darkest Dungeon
so far
yeah in the same way we all like tentacle porn to begin with
I bet Jamie doesn't
just a hunch
but 43 minutes in and you being to recognise that somebody sat down and animated this shit
i bet he wouldn't like Darkest Dungeon either
suddenly its not so fun
I've had one person die
but tbf, they only died because I didn't know you could run
and I ran into a boss in a hallway, who had 70hp and life steal
and summons
who heal it
in an easy level dungeon
I'm only a little bitter
but they were brand new so I guess I didn't lose much
it wasnt your crusader?
because i swear to fucking god
nah man, he's still good
so is my highwayman
the number of times ive felt like actually hurting myself because i lost one of those two
I've quite a few different classes now
the one that died was an Occultist
seemed pretty cool too
had a 0-13 heal
with 33% chance to inflict bleed
haven't seen that free dlc class yet
yeah if you dont have a couple healing classes you can rotate between squads youre fucked
i also always you poison with one of the female classes
yeah I guess I was lucky enough to get two of those female priests
i cant remember what its called but they have throwing knives and shit
yeah I know what you mean
yeah it can be annoying how much you have to rely on who shows up
I've just been getting a few unneeded extras in case
but i promise you its not as annoying as getting fucked by RNG in the most decisive battle in europeon history and being set back 200 years
I guess so
you've been going pretty hard with that
isaac im fucking pissed already
i can make good headway with france in the long run, but i run out of patience and get greedy
i end up accidently forcing europe to form the united nations 600 years before its supposed to and triggering a world war because i decided and i wanted al sace AND lorraine
but if i play as england i could actually force all of france into a lesser union and annex the entire country allowing me to form an uncontested British empire long before im supposed to
can you imagine how the thirteen colonies might have prospered without the threat of french-canada?
people just hate the french
these fucking arseholes even suck with my english brain guiding them
theres no other result the 100 years war can conclude with after the treaty of tours in may of 1444
by november the french king besieges Maine while english forces are still trying to prevent the war of roses, scotland sees them as any easy target, and the English lose all control over ireland baring the pale
you cant rule ireland from dublin when you still have what is essentially 12 distinct clans with their tribal way of life dictating how they respond to authority
this is why ireland had to be united under british rule
but nooo
the fucking french just had to retrieve Maine
it took even longer to recover normandy and aquitaine
even when they had every advantage, all they did was hinder the growth of the british empire
can you give me a quick history briefing? What was the 100 years war?
hold the fucking on
im getting back out of bed
hah
dude you probably have lectures tomorrow
so 1066 is basically the turning point for all medieval history and is what triggered a huge number of conflicts throughout europe
yeah dude but this is far more interesting
these issues can actually be traced all the way back to Pepin, king of francia and the arbitrary way he pitted his sons against each other
i could even get into how fucked Charlemagne's mother must have been to poison her own son but thats conspiracy theory level bullshit
either way the Karling dynasty fragments, and every preceding great dynasty is essientally a cadet branch, whether youre looking at france, italy or the holy roman empire
the thing with William the Bastard is he was such an underdog, and the way he came to power and sought the support not just of those in his own realm and court, but of the french nobles who at the time should have been loyal to the king could actually be considered the inspiration for Machiavellian's The Prince
no doubt the character of Edmund is a semi-tribute to this
but this prick conquers England, not against 'all odds' because he simply mopped up what was left of the english army after the Norwegians failed in their own conquest
many at the time saw this victory as a good thing, as the vast majority of the bourgeoisie where replaced with French nobles who fought for William
theres actually an example of this in Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles, but hes a romantic piece of shit who loved god
anyway, France soon comes to the conclusion that they should strengthen their bond by marrying into Williams new found House, but he ends up having a shitload of bastards because hes a sadistic fuck who has no empathy
french cunt
this is a problem, because it leads to all sorts of inheritance issues
for the longest time, bastards have been considered to have the weakest of claims in any case, but if a bastard like William can manipulate and fight their way to the top, then perhaps we should treat them like human beings
mostly its fine, England spends the next couple hundred years fucking and murdering their way through wales and large areas in ireland, until they decide to use their long, complicated, and precariously circular family history to claim large parts of france
paris and the duchy it belonged to, along with Aquitaine and Maine are all taken during the 1300s, while brittany manages to evade vassalisation and Burgundy claims freedom and grows to be a ridiculousy powerful duchy independent of both French and HRE rule
the situation is made worse by Provence inheriting Anjou and using strategic alliances to avoid recapture, along with Savoy creating a buffer between France and Italy
Tom this is the opposite of a brief
fuck off
this is cool
the hundred years war didnt exactly last 100 years
its actually just an umbrella term used to describe this series of unfortunate events
the problem was that England benefitted the most to begin with, but over extended themselves
you have to understand that for an island nation they did a great job of making enemies of everyone around them
made even worse by the internal struggles that arose as a result of not being a fully despotic monarchy
the monarch would have to put everything through parliament, and this would make negotiation even tougher
the ruler couldnt just give out land to trusted friends like William once did, nor could they push laws to keep the peasants in check to avoid an english rebellion
in the early 1440s, both France and England had suffered heavy loses, and the hosues of Valois and Lancastar traded land to avoid further conflict
the only issue was that diplomats not only acted independently from the king, but the king ignored the parliament
this led to a huge issue arising between King Henry VII and the house of york
see York didn't even have a seat in parliament, but made the point of threatening civil war if any further French territory was ceded to the French
now most of the deals had already fallen through, but Maine was not to be reallocated until AFTER the initial ceasefire in May
so you can imagine how the ruling class must have felt both being threatened with civil war in the north and french retaliation in the south
along with trying to keep both Scotland and Ireland from pushing for more control
this could have been resolved diplomatically, even when the French king showed up at the gates of the fortress in Maine and demanded concession, but Henry was a complete fucking dirtbag
this guy was incredibly detached from reality, and there are so many reports that he wasn't just delusion, but basically mentally and emotionally aloof
he didnt seem to care at all about what was happening in his kingdom, and instead was more intent on moving the court to a hunting lodge in Berry
when it came time to make a decision, Henry chose to war with France again to demonstrate loyalty to his people, but the war of roses ende up kicking off anyway
its interesting how individual characters can make such a large impact in history, but when you begin to give control to the masses chaos can ensue
for instance, if Henry was more headstrong, or the French king was more patient, perhaps there could have been a lasting peace between the two nations
if William had taken more care with his lineage, perhaps a junior partnership with France would have been feasible
had England won the war for Maine, France would have been forced into vassalhood for England
just fucking imagine how that would have changed both the future of Europe and America
Theres an interesting documentary that studies the development of empires or vast kingdoms, and through analysing patterns it demonstrates that no empire has lasted longer than 250 years before reaching its height and decaying
just imagine how Trump is affecting the future rn
its demonstrated that this is when reforms can prolong the life of civilizations, but the change has to be dramatic
well this is whats so interested my dude
America was formed from the 13 colonies almost 250 years ago
its stuck by and large to its original constitution for that long as well
during the final years of the original Roman empire, the public was fed a variety of entertainment to keep them placated, and a growing obsession for famous athletes, chefs and a litany of celebrities contributed to the similar wealth divide you see between classes today
im not saying that these obsessions are a recent thing with the modern US, and i despise arguments that seem to consider events happening today to be even bigger and more bold than they were in the past, but people are constantly making these kind of comparisons
i would be really entertained if all of the US just fucking collasped tomorrow
the government just said 'fuck it, good luck you chumps'
or if a group of gun wielding fanatics stormed the whitehouse and put some previously unheard of third party in control
well I don't think that second one is going to happen
no
but there was a lot of talk about a civil war if clinton was elected
like thats completely ridiculous and wouldnt have happened
but that clock is ticking
the clock of idiocy
you know it was in finally in 1707 that England finally formed the british empire
this was after all their french land was gone, and it was actually a result of a marriage gone wrong between england and scotland that left them as a junior partner of england
and then the empire was finally officially dissolved in the 90s
now thats way over 250 years, but the majority of our larger territory was lost directly after WW1
hah
im just saying that fits the bill
yeah that sounds fine
i will say theres a large exception to the rule
and thats the fucking Mali empire
im telling you dude, if the sahara hadn't turned into a desert thousands of years ago, there would never have been any muslims in norther africa or even spain
there wouldnt have been a split in the caliphate because everyone would have believed in their animist religion
holy fucking shit did these guys mean business
imagine this, if you fucking will
Mali grows due to its ability to travel long distances quickly using a system of canoes in the jungle rivers, silently and very fucking sneakily
over time, they amass a *standing* army of over 100,000
this is in the 1200s my dude
even the fucking holy roman empire could only manage like 40 or 50k
and these are backwater spearchucking niggers we're on about
oof
hard er
okay so ive just read up on it and they did eventually turn muslim
but thats not the point
they never expanded north because black people are cry babies and couldnt stand the heat of the sahara
but i hear a lot from my racist folk that blacks had no culture or history until we 'found them'
the same isn't applied to native americans because they had casinos or whatever
but even Joseph Conrad, progressive fucking prick that he was failed to acknowledge that the blacks where anything more than tribal animals fighting amongst each other and using very basic human drives of power and sex to achieve dominance over one another
these fuckers lasted over 400 years, and they really prospered during this time
have you ever seen a map of Africa in the build up to WW2?
there are maybe 3 African nations, the rest is split between England, France, Italy and Belgium
these fucking 'colonists' who brought 'civilisation' and white supremacy to Africa completely neglected the hundreds of years these people were able to stand tall and unite
im not saying their empire could have actually rivalled many European Kingdoms at the time, but by their own continental standards, it was huge
cool
The Kouroukan Fouga also put in place social and economic reforms including prohibitions on the maltreatment of prisoners and slaves, installing documents between clans which clearly stated who could say what about whom. Also, Sundiata divided the lands amongst the people assuring everyone had a place in the empire and fixed exchange rates for common products
okay that is a line describing one of the reformations that took place about halfway through the empires lifespan
TOM
even the fucking bible says its okay to beat your slave as long as they can get up by the end of the week
THIS IS MORE INTERESTING THAN WHAT YOU WERE SAYING PREVIOUSLY BUT PLEASE
dude just fucking look at it
thats the most preogressive reform i think ive ever seen come out of the feudal period
how are you not fucking amazed by this?
i know i sometimes give the coons a hard time, and i like to razz them every now and then
yes, a hidden empire not built on assholes managed to last longer than average
but this is fucking incredible
oh great so you're a fucking racist
an empire not looking to expand I imagine
okay cool
oh no expand it did you bitch
forcefully?
it just happened to be fighting stupider niggers
well yeah
how else to open a jar of mayo dude
I mean why even bother
the means could have justified the ends
on the other hand the industry that benefitted from the slave trade was tremendously reliant on the well toned bodies of the descendants of this empire
like someone had to take one for the team ya know
holy shit you know the Mansa was so fucking rich that when he went on hajj to mecca he gave out a bunch of money along the way and actually caused notable inflation into the middle eastern kingdoms
I have no idea who Mansa is, or what a hajj is, or any middle eastern kingdoms
okay well the middle east is
complicated
good
it can stay that way
but a Mansa is king
and a hajj is basically a pilgrimage
i figured that
all muslims must make the hajj at some point in their life, since Muhammad did it once
these armies had the fucking balls to have a ratio of 3 bowmen to a single spearman
like you would be there with your pointy stick with three fucking bowmen with poison arrows to support you
thats fucking metal dude
nothing but pigskin to protect your nuts from the enemy
China and Japan tended to have every warrior trained in the bow
Maybe this doesnt seem like much when you look at the roman, the british, the hre, Francia, the ottoman, the mamluk, the chinese, the japenese, or the byzantine empires
but of all of those this one saw the least amount of combat and some of the most progressive social and technological reforms
and honestly most aspects of its society from architecture to social normities are more fucking interesting than any of those
i think i might have actually lost my racism
this sounds like a utopia
i wish i was black and lived 700 years ago
I'll remember to put that on your grave
for fucks sake
the point is that of every other empire something fucking tragic happened at the height and saw a decline oover the next hundred years
these were just some nice ass dudes trying to better themselves and eating some chicken, but if you fucked with them they brought down their massie black cock war machine on you
and that i can respect
cant say the same for the bickering cadet families of the fucking Karlings
i mean what a bunch of cunts
to revolutionise europe by brigning an entire continent out of the dark age, recovering from the confusion and chaos that filled the vaccuum after the roman rule was vanquished and whats the fucking plan?
aw i want my kids to get along, lets give each one a fucking retard amount of land and hope it doesnt start a civil war the likes of which have never been seen before
and Charlemagne was a cunt
he actually invaded italy because of his brother's ex
he went into spain because he was a racist
he actually fucking 'Christianised' saxons on pain of death
those wars were so bloody and so unnecessary
and you'd think that europe would have learned something about pagan aggresssion from the thousands of francian soldiers who died pointlessly trying to destroy irminsul
nope lol
i dont think much of Ragnarr lothbroks story is true, like that must be a fucking legend with a tonne of hyperbole
but the idea that vikings raped and pillaged isnt entirely true in later contexts
many of them just wanted more habitable lands to settle, just like the first colonists in the new world
because nobles and duchies wouldnt sell them land they decided to take it by force, and fair fucking play to those lads
it would be one thing if they could actually work together or anyone had managed to unify England, but they were so perfectly jealous and short-sighted
things would be so much better if i were every great person in history dude, im telling you
look im bored of this conversation and need to piss, so ill speak to you tomorrow
Cya
yeah okay you racist
Alright Mr wishes he was a black guy with a hard ER
Well
I half read that
And I discovered that reading paragraph after paragraph about things that happened over 600 years ago isn't really my thing

doctor who?
jamie come back
hello
yes doctor who
that's what i said
can you read
i dont think he made her come
should i go apologise on his behalf
it takes tom to know tom
no i didnt watch doctor poo
why not
because i havent seen infinity war
ugh
come on catch up
im watching infinity war
Hey Jamie what did you think of doctor who
Hey Isaac what did you think of doctor who
I thoiuyght it was great
one of the better introductory episodes
IF YOU SPOIL ONE FUCKING FRAME OF THIS FILM FOR ME I WILL RAPE YOUR PETS
it actually had the doctor in
thats strange
I think she should have been more verbose
david tennant and peter capaldi's introductory episodes both had them asleep most of the time
i made a fucking joke guys
Tom that was an appalling joke
Moving on
youre ignorant of the facts
Doctor strange
is that super-sherlock
why does this film start in space
i thought tony stark lived in LA
Thor
Guardians of the Galaxy
hes always late to the fight because LAX is always delaying everything
what the fuck
guardians of the galaxy is a memthology though
what does that have to do with iron man vs captain batman
Well I hope you've watched Thor ragnarok
And guardians 1 & 2
uh
And Spiderman homecoming
omfg theres that nigger hero movie as well
Black panther
the one where instead of the actually movie people kept getting sent rise of the planet of the apes
that was fucking hilarious
all these fucking marvel movies
who the fuck cares anymore
you have to watch so many fucking films
to understand any of it
Says the guy who watched literally all of doctor who classic
you'd have to be the kind of nobhead who watches 26 seasons of classic doctor who just to get the references in the newer stuff
There we go
okay im ready to leave my review
thanos seems like a mean dude but its okay because hes kind of sad
tony hark is basically my dream dad
and the female one is fucking hot
i've only ever seen thanos in the context of being compared to the heavy from tf2
That's fair
where did thors eye go
WATCH THE GODDAMN MOVE
Y
what the fuck is a tesseract
aw loki is lowkey a pretty cool dude
hey if you want me to set up a rabbit i can give you some live ass witty commentary while everyone tries to watch the fucking film
the hulk is a fucking lightweight - ive said it from day one
a tesseract is a 4d cube
yeah it looked more like a lightbulb tbh
It's the whole point of the first avengers movie
yo in this world black people are magic?
dude im switching sides
And the captain Africa movie
AMERICA
FUCK
okay so how sad am i that the black guy already died?
hahaha captain africa
and the first Thor movie
yeah okay marvel nerd
im just here for thanos chin
Wonderful
I'm setting up a rabbit
wehat teh fck
i have no idea how that works
Great
is there a guide for achieving thanos-like physique?
there's the thanos diet
removes half your body fat
that's definitely not the Thanos look
but very funny
STOP WITH THE FUCKING SPOILING I WANT TO SEE THE PLOT UNFOLD FOR MYSELF
i haven't even seen the movie
and i made the joke myself
sweetie spoilers
why the fuck is bendy dick cum a bunch in this movie and do they make him say 'penguins' at any point
because he's benny thick cumbersome and everyone loves him
ew tony stark is old now
when the fuck did that happen
HAHAH MAKE FUN OF THE GUY WITH THE LONG NAME
between 1 and 8 years ago Tom
he does have a funny name though
this movie just killed creationism for me
like a buddhist convert?
yeah god doesn't exist
it's just a bunch of superheroes
what a let down
bummer
oh shit does tin bro not like patriot dude?
nah they fought
you've definitely seen that
ah shit
the london eye is fucking up again
its making insect boy's hair fuck about
its also in chicago for some reason
HOLY SHIT LEE HARVEY OSWALD IS DRIVING THE BUS
what's the london eye doing in chicago
idk but im pretty sure ive figured out who the spiderman is now
Hey Tom, you use chrome right?
hahaha the green guys penis wont work
or i think thats the joke
yes i use chrome, fuck me what am a peasant
oh yeah I forgot about Vision
weird
im proud to be a firefox user
for now
im not particularly loyal to a specific browser
well good luck creating a rabbit room
i just switch when i get annoyed at one
what's a rabbit room
holy fuck this ugly guy just cut a car in half by glaring at it!!!
sorry my bad
basically its a website that allows large numbers of people to get into a chat room and jerk off to the same pornography
yeah i don't want a part in that
yeah no, that's not what it is
it's just streaming a stream to other people
but easier than setting up a stream on twitch or something
and they can be private rooms
so just like hosting on twitch
yeah no i would fucking know asshole im the leading porn dude in over 50 fucking rooms
and you can just watch netflix and stuff
i tell a lie i just join other peoples porn rooms and tell them theyre bad at porn
what's a free streaming service?
iplayer
a free illegal streaming service
kodi
though i think you need a box
idk how all that's set up
ffs
Tom?
Fuck you I ain't no snitch
but naw i went legit years before
gfd
why do you ask, isaac?
how are you watching infinity war then?
i bought it on youtube for a fiver
just dont fucking laugh at me dude
I'm not amused
just disappointed
i bought vsauce's two paid series on youtube
worth
alright well you need a chrome extension in order to share your screen using rabbit
i don't know about watching that screen
on this CPU?
I'm not sure about delay
supposedly it's very little
but I mean, isn't it basically the same as using screen share on this?
dude you know that enough to fuck me up for life
what?
that's
why the fuck is there an ant woman in this
she simultaneously makes me want to jerk off and slam my dick in the freezer
general reposti
alright well
I have netflix
that's about the extent of what we could watch using rabbit
how come thor can breathe in space?
he's the fucking norse god of thunder Tom
woooah hold on
yeah well thats beside the point
but these guys are in the same universe?
jesus christ
you know what
I'm not even sure I want to watch it with you
i have almost the entirety of red dwarf if that's anything worth watching to you
yeah i mean im quite happy to travel to watch a film with my fucking boys
hey bitch thats on netflix dumbass
well i don't have netflix
regardless
Tom, if you install the rabbit chrome extension it's pretty self explanatory
youve got a profile on my netflix
aw dude are we doing this?
I've invested enough time in it
so yes
might be useful in future too so
sure
and i invested time in your asspussy would that mean id be doing that?
is it just the browser
can i not stream my game
it's just the browser
HAVE YOU HEARD OF TWITCH THOUGH?
we should try parsec again jamie
I know I can't stream from my pc, but you can so
oh wow due 2 and a half stars
i trust this shit
yeah it's because it didn't used to need an extension
then they forced everyone to use it
and it's worse apparently
sounds shady
it's fine
it really is
maybe i was thinking of gay rabbit
I'm in it rn
like when ccleaner was exposed for collecting and selling your data
if you opted in to a setting
then they had it on by default
https://lets.rabb.it/RdLggasbRQ
then they hid the setting
there
try that
then they made it mandatory
dude I use ccleaner
oh well
dafuq do I care about my data
that's my fucking head
yeah I needed a profile pic
yours was one of the first in my pictures file
join my room asshole
give me a link asshole
oh
is your room private?
https://www.rabb.it/Bunny1522082179944
is your ass private bitch?
yes
https://www.rabb.it/Bunny1522082179944

https://www.rabb.it/Bunny1522082179944
Jamie you still have parsec right?
probably
Jamie what are you doing
not using my fuckin mic or video on a shady website
ok
what about the text chat
im not tabbing out to respond to everything
it's bad enough having to use the discord overlay
the site text chat I mean
can you just not address me please
fine
is that fucking paddingtonbear
no the paddington bear that was there before bradley cooper
dude idfk
easier
for me
what bitrate is this
5?
next slide
I ALREADY MADE THAT JOKE
what what
did you say me
wherefore
what do you tihnk
you know that means why right
BECAUSE I CARE
jamie boot up parsec rn
tom can't use it he has integrated graphics
yeah but you can use it
parsec is actually distance
what?
yeah ok
whatever
they misused it in star wars
not the point
not dealing with parsec right now
point is we can try out aco2 rn
im going in a minute
fine
don't worry then
tell tom it wont work
God fucking damnit
where did you go
https://parsec.gg/p/hmGa7C

I'm staying awake another hour just because you said that
good
open parsec
I'm on mobile Mr laptop failure
alright dude
at least I can get discord overlay to work on my first try
using it rn
!quote
That's what I think of you
fair
Jamie we're just confused
these tweets are real
why?
for why?
*for why?*
They're obviously inside jokes among a tightly knit community
that's what we thought
but like
88 likes?
where is the community though
the comments act the same way
whence my dude, whence
but ive found 5 of these bizzare ass accounts all with different tropes
What the comments are as confused as we are?
no
they seem to be able to make sense of it
and post equally weird replies
Reach out to them
DMs
from one of the twitter accounts
reply from random twitter account
You sure they aren't markov bots
There's tons of them on twitter
that's what I thought originally
but wouldn't it say that somewhere
and why are there so many likes
Not necessarily
and retweets
theyre so varied too
and fairly comprehensible
nothing like yours
also they're way better than our markov
That's because mine is shit
https://twitter.com/degg
Imagine the amount of Me: etc. tweets they can source
take a fucking look
https://twitter.com/Dwayne37
Jamie help
it's like eldritch scripture
Well
Don't think Dwaynes a bot
degg isnt a bot either
He has two tweets relating to each other
why does he have *toothpick legs* Jamie?
***for why?***
how is that second one so much more legible
and relevant
then the third is like fucking interpretive dance
JAMIE WHAT THE FUCK
did you typo the word make?
Whoops
no it's genius
it's perfect
Ugh Dwaynes tweets are marginally normal
why johnny sun
I can't DM the degg guy because he has it set so he has to be following me
Anyone else?
https://twitter.com/pr0spector88
https://twitter.com/normal_now
JAMIE STOP
WE FOUND AN ANSWER
Whaaaaat
What is it
jump in chat
dude stay away from dwayne
https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/12/19/459387407/an-odd-uplifting-alien-meet-the-man-behind-a-weird-twitter-star?t=1539040248112
I can't
DELETE YOUR DMs
it's like
almost satire
i still don't understand
so they're not bots
it's just one guy being weird?
maybe?
its not johnny sun
but his weird 'outsider look on life' might have triggered this 'subculture' on twitter
but these are supposed to be ironic and satirical
but they're kind of just not
jamie do you know what absurd literature is?
it's like when someone mishears a saying
no
because its that but for twitter
well fuck
then someone mishears that saying
like banksy
i sort of get it
if you say so
like antijokes but for memes
i still think there's a bit of automation in there
https://twitter.com/kothscreens
!markov
that's not a bad idea
i should do that on here
hey i didn't write that
doing what
most of it is probably written for you
just load the mp4 file
into memory
true ok not into memory
someone will have written a library to do stuff with video files
you pick a random number between 0 and the max frame number
then you seek to that number frame in the video file
well
most of it would be in the external mp4 library
took a lot more work to make !quote
https://gyazo.com/7ad7170d59ec96841fe988d0c2c8512a
main reason i won't do the mp4 thing is it's hosted on a free tier amazon server with almost no storage
missed all of that
wha
good fucking l-
uck?
luck
ok
you can't dislike on twitter
yeah what
what's michael from vsauce doing on there
chad is a country
what are people from chad called
chadians?
huh
yep it's chadians
that looks like donald duck x squidward
cats are mans real best friend
my son, age 8: volkisch_groyper on roblox redpilled me on the slavic question.
me: that's nice kiddo. wanna see deadpool 2 next weekend? tell your mom to remember to drive you over this time or i'll see her in court.
you dont need to fucking walk them
me: i don't know anything about an incel rebellion. i don't know anyone named chad, i don't know any stacies. i'm just a simple gamer.
cop: alright, you're free to go.
[cop has an epiphany while looking at the evidence board and runs out to catch me but i've already disappeared]
oh have we moved on from degg
this is a slippery slope
you'll find yourself on the dark web in another few clicks
that's literally racist

do you think eliott rodger was gay
tom probably does
neat
what if the song is 20 mins long
dude idfk
oh i've seen that channel before
i don't like it
there's no substance to it
it's just a guy browsing reddit and collecting stuff that he knows will get him the views
i can just browse reddit
omfg that kindle repair video
i'd rather cut things out myself
i don't think that was actually hillary clinton
good
hahhahahaha
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BPn42l5elA&ab_channel=DailyDoseOfInternet
that ehow video is one of the only videos i have both disliked and added to favourites
it's awful
because it's awful
it's almost like he's on drugs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbmIEBi6mas
just the way he says "but it might not... thanks for watching"
shit
your laptop is shit
they hated jesus because he told them the truth
shut up!
this is a serious tutorial channel
you've heard of ehow
yeah but it's like would you rather watch fox news or read reuters
ive got chill
FUCK OFF
yeah man im chill
how does that work
i'll show you how chill i am
!markov

Juggalo

ugh
sorry im not colourblind
i don't have tom's gift
they need tactile bumps as well
for people like you
gj isaac
no not braille
yeah like the textured slabs next to road crossings
for blind people to know they're by the road
yeah
you getting this isaac
tom's turning into a robot
i missed that
i was too busy being concerned for the organic component of tom
who says its an inside meme

FUCK YOU
what happened to your fertility treatment course
you stopped at 3/6
that's disappointing
i was thinking of re-enabling the lead brick thing
since you don't say it as much
remember for a short period it would respond with ***__LEAD BRICK__***
every time you said lead brick
lead brick
yeah
because you got pissed off
what if i get it to choose a random word from the most common 500 words
and it changes every day
and it can only happen once
per day
so some days it might not happen at all
but then one day someone might say "otherwise" and the bot goes ***__OTHERWISE__***
yeah we can experiment with that
nah
i can use the same API that i use for word of the day
just to get the most common words
rest of it is a ciece of pake
i can't type in that channel
but now ive got to read in that channel and respond on this
isaac gets to just speak
i can't do that
i've got to be invested in one or the other
fuck i mean the only time i willingly get up before 9am is on saturday morning
saturday mornings are beast
it's more like i just can't get back to sleep on saturday mornings
or sunday mornings
any time when i am able to have a lie in
i can't
yeah but i want to have more sleep
that cut off after is
you said

OH WOW THATS A GREAT BOT
!woke
(At the betting on e-sports because other sports are over , time of the evening) Let's go team cloud 9 in rainbow six pro league.
Just listening through mike oldfield and Jon Anderson popped up
2 of the best prog legends did a collab
I've had a thought
I think the third doctor was the best classic doctor
He was the last grandad like one
And he had a yellow car called Bessie
And he was based at UNIT and everything was on earth and the Brig was there
I enjoyed that era
You ducking hipster
But was that Jon pertwee?
Yes
Figures
Are people meant to do things in the afternoon
I find that very hard to believe
Not hard things
Or learning things actually
Little fact from a primary school teacher
Kids learn less after 1-ish
Don't know if that carries over to adults
Definitely carries over
My work day ends at 17:30 but I have to go up and check the data centre every day at 17:00 and you can go fuck yourself if you think I'm doing any work in the remaining 30 mins
The afternoon is just a slightly larger version of that after lunch
Do you ever get hair pulled out of your leg by your jeans and then it fucking burns but not too bad but enough to be more annoying than painful
Not in the leg I shaved
And not in the other one either
You're a fucking weirdo
Says the guy who shaved one of his legs
The leg is still there as far as I can tell
What about the hairs
!play divine fits shiver
- Now!
!woke
ok
if this bot were a politician
it would be nick clegg
great
nice reference
no idea why it keeps doing that
it spits out an error message but i can't make sense of it
either that or it actually is discord's fault
!woke
!woke
get fucking roasted
i saw that
You're as blind as a dead Tibetan monk you little bitch
why tibetan?
Guys I might be off to a drug deal in a little bit
Weed has 'set a meet'
wow
could be gay sex, never know
that guy watches his movies
people don't fucking say that
what's wrong with "meeting a friend"
Idk
He's been criticising how the next corridor over do their weed
It's all wrong
But to be fair they do like to smoke their room out
It's entertaining watching it billow out from under the door
you sure that's not just because it makes its way to you and you get off your face from the smoke
I don't get off my face okay
I'm actually immune to drugs
oooohhhhh yeahhhh
me tooo
Tell me dude
What do you know of beta blockers
wood
plastic
thin sheet of metal
in general, beta particles are lighter than alpha particles, and they generally have a greater ability to penetrate other materials. as a result, these particles can travel a few feet in the air, and can penetrate skin
!woke
dude what the fuck is a wakanda
i thought that was from my little pony
something that wakands things
yeah I'm not even gonna respect that question
youve got a real bad superiority complex
alright Chad Thundercock
[passing by smiling couple holding hands in public] lol nice cope normie
nobody passes by them
they take up the whole pavement
you have to awkwardly linger behind them until they get out the way
Oh shit boy Jamie dropping some red pill truths
strawberry tictac*
why doesnt sherlock holmes just teleport the big chin dude into a locked room or something
because you touch yourself at night
lolrandom xD :3
And why is the midget from game of thrones taller than everyone
he's a giant
get it
a midget who is a giant
what a stupid fucking idea
why do the black people have laser spears?
is this what the empire of mali was like?
you two are just regular laurel and hardys huh
also yes
yanny
yea i still have parsec on here
good
my magazine finally arrived
now I just need to wait for my rucksack
What is your magazine about
dude idk
health
fucking drawings
I'll send you the description on the front if you like
I'm not that invested if you aren't
design - art - photography - fashion - travel - music - craft - home - life
that's its subtitle
Sounds like your magazine covers everything
seems like it
hey, maybe it's actually good
I'm intrigued as to your apparent impatience at the arrival of your magazine only to display general apathy towards its contents
alright I'll spill
it's not actually for me
I bought it as a gift
but for right now
it is me who owns it
a brand new magazine!
nov/dec issue
wonderful
know what else is wonderful?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmUHFgNFRG0
how did they even think to try this
it almost works perfectly
well I've never heard toxicity
oh
it'll only half work then
you gotta listen to system of a down
I'm sure I'll appreciate the mood
it's the right kind of different
as opposed to the wrong kind
I've heard Chop Suey
why'd you leave the keys upon the table
***TABLE***
***TABLE TABLE TABLE TABLE TABLE***
it does work really well though
there're a couple of questionable moments but yeah they really fit
i think they're both in the normal tempo as well
I would say it works painfully well
but this video came out 6 years ago
how'd you even find it
maybe it's because i know how toxicity goes that it isn't completely perfect for me
perhaps
idk it popped up
i get a lot of music theory shit
though this is pushing it
don't know if it was Tom's ramblings, but I got suggested a History Misconceptions vid
chances are you'll know the one I mean
hmmm
not off the top of my head
well just give youtube a few more days
I swear to god it pushes advertised vids fucking *hard*
when you say advertised vids
like sponsored ones?
I guess
let me put it this way
i have adblock
no not like that
it can't block sponsors though
let me ask you one question
Can you cast obsidian?
cast
like
pour it into a mold?
well shit
I guess it is just me
i don't understand
clearly
it was a vid that was in the suggested bar of every youtube video I watched for about a month
for really no reason
you most likely can
but I got the impression that I wasn't the only one
dude I didn't watch it
I don't care
can you cast glass
I was too busy watching people drink gross shots
i imagine you can cast glass
maybe into a flexible mould
i mean people don't do that because you jsut blow it
but
if you can do it with glass
Jamie that really wasn't the point of the question
you can probably do it with obsidian
because obsidian is glass
that's like if someone asks you "Does the pope shit in the woods" and you dissecting whether it's a physical possibility
no
the difference
is
you asked "**can** you cast obsidian?"
not "did you see the video where the guy tries to melt obsidian and mold it?"
yes
I did
and i answered your question
to the best of my ability
both work to the same effect
I got my answer
the fault was in your choice of question
then you gave me some irrelevant shit
you wind me with your spiky insults
look Jamie
Is your fridge running?
no i switch it off at night
see
you can do it
yeah but it makes the food go off
look dude no-one turns off their fridge at night
really?
I'm just proud you're holding to some standard
and what standard would that be?
last time I asked someone that they told me to go fuck myself
speaking of
would you consider masturbation a form of fucking yourself?
how does that bear any relation to fridges
answer the question Jamie
this one was an honest one
surprisingly
it depends
on?
whether you consider masturbation a form of fucking yourself
great
way to be true to yourself
yes
isn't that what it is by definition
from what you've told me, you would only consider masturbation a form of fucking yourself if I, in turn, considered masturbation to be a form of fucking myself
ah no
you see
i was using "you" in the fourth person
hold on
just 1 sec
alright all good
go right ahead
the fuck's wrong with that
nothing at all Jamie

like
this conversation has changed dramatically
is it?
i thought it was gary numan
whom?
cars
oh
see I get every Gary mixed up with Gary Jones
and Gary Jules
good job i don't know who gary jones is then
yeah he's just some bloke from Reading
honestly people who live in reading
cunts
they're either ruining your name experience, or setting fucking 'meets'
tbf Gary Jones is dead now
well at least he's got that going for him
oof
family friend btw
you could've warned me
hahah
no this is what I wanted
i'd have made a worse joke
nice
!wotd
wtf
Fone Phoney and Smiley Bone
well
you're totally Smiley Bone
no need to thank me for the brilliant nickname
meh
I'm sure Tom will have no objections to being Phoney
that makes you Fone Bone
that's boring
alright welsh
because saying something no one understands is a right joke
anyway
in answer to your question
no
the pope probably doesn't shit in the woods
tempted to pin that too
trouble is I don't even know if that was the correct question
oh fucking hell
bad enough there being right and wrong answers
now there are right and wrong questions?
this is why you need to read kids books
i really don't
no you don't
might be nice though
what's in it for me
hey Tom's away now
idk dude
a re-found sense of childlike wonder
a revival of once forgotten hope
nostalgic nerve pains
i get all that when i take a shit
huh
probably bipolar
WHAT DID YOU JUST CALL ME
what was that one that triggers Tom
not the foreskin one
the psychology one
schizophrenia
yes
that
ha sometimes i think i have schizophrenia becasue im so forgetfal!! ==D
ha1
well that should piss him off tomorrow
depends
on?
well firstly
its already tomorrow
now you're arguing symantec
ignoring that, secondly he might look at it tonight
we live in suspense
happy piano song
thanks
although
I think it's actually a sad piano song 😦
lol that was a question
lol
alright what?
i can't stop lauging
great
whatz a happy piano song
https://giphy.com/gifs/season-4-the-simpsons-4x12-3o6MbbARLTpkwTpB5e
oh man
you know what this reminds me of
!define mr booze
well I refute that bird is the word part
but then I would wouldn't I
im okay now
good
listening to happy piano song
yeah I can see
you're listening to songs I've actually heard of
[gasp]
can you imagine this played on a synth in the 80s
i'd love to hear that
well
funny you should ask
a little game called Starbound
whaaaat
lets you play a myriad of classical songs, on a myriad of simulated instruments
some of them have harmonies
but sorry Jamie
you wouldn't *like* it
I mean, other than the fact that it's literally Terraria in space
yeah didn't think i would
terraria is overrated
trust me
I mean
I played it
it's in my steam library
a reasonable amount
I would argue it was less overrated than Minecraft
its then-time rival
we all know how that went down
minecraft is 3d
that's a whole nother fuckin dimension buddy
!define shallow
wow
very accurate
I'm impressed
😃
and they needed that extra dimension to store all that cash
hah
can't have cash without breadth
fourth
fifth
breadth
sixth
seventh
breast
what's your point
simulating the adoption of the english language by an alien who can detect and follow patterns but only has access to a collins pocket dictionary
a pocket dictionary with no pockets!
disaster
where would it put all the words
precisely
oh haha
indeed
how would it eat shoots and leaves
or eat, shoot and leave
did you know you can do an upside down comma like this '
[gasp]
this is a thing now
I blame you
plaease dont do that
make me not
*make me don't
sorry im pulling your legume
monster from the blu legume
what's a legume
one day they're going to record this on mars
Fuck yeah just got tickets to muse at the Royal Albert Hall
What was my purpose in life again
Jesus god
Fucking
Aahh
Nietzsche: “If god is so smart then how come he’s dead? Haha owned bitch”
God: "if Nietzsche is so smart then how come he's dead? Haha owned bitch"
Dude I can't be arsed to get out of bed
At this point I've been in it for over 12 hours
So I might as well keep going
Go for 24 dude
But I have a 50 minute lecture at 12
Have you got food in your reach
Uhhh
FaceTime someone
Or whatever it is
There might be a cookie on my desk
FaceTime is for Apple sheep
Then 'video call'
Apple got the good names at least
Yeah like 'Big Mac'
Oh fucking wait
Is this what depression feels like?
Because you assholes must be a couple of real downers if that's the case
Yeah staying in bed is a big thing with us depressionists
As the fucking leaf blower is at it again right outside my fucking window
Also not getting up from the loo because you have nothing better to do
I reckon a leaf blower would help me sleep
But like a hairdryer
Bit
Don't tell me you spend an anti social amount of time on the shitter
Only like 40 mins a day
Oof
That's gotta be a yikes from me
Sorry did I say minutes
I meant hours
You should try this sometime
I'm not sure if I can remember how to walk anyway
Try what
Ignoring all 20 of your alarms
I only need 4
I'm up and out the bed like a spring
A spring with no force applied to it
Just lying in a bed
This is what happens when people keep me up until 3 am watching shitty marvel movies
Wow you know some real fucking plebs
They're the head mods
I'm in a really good mood right now
Got tickets to muse, and I asked my boss for Monday off and he said yes, I also asked him for the entire first week of December off and he said yes
I'm fuckin good

MOTHERFUCJER
Shit
Try asking him if you can spend Christmas round his
One day they're gonna fire me and go through my laptop and find an RDP to a strange Amazon server hidden in the recycling bin
That's not a good hiding place
Well I need it every now and then
Otherwise I have to redownload it from Amazon and that's a pain in the ass to authenticate
Have you thought about a downloads folder just called 'things' or 'other'
But then it isn't in my quick access
You on your way to Salisbury?
What in heck does that mean
It means you look like a Russian spy
Lul
#stillinbed
Yeah harsh words coming from someone still under the impression that Napoleon was a midget
I envy you but am also glad I got to work early
He was
But he was also a giant
What a stupid fucking idea
You don't think a midget would like the chance to play a giant
Nah it's cause the imperial system lied
Yeah because Hagrid would have been all the more giant-like if he were played by Warwick Davis
It would have been funnier
I think he would be disappointed
I think you should watch Infinity War
This isn't fucking guardians of the galaxy
Well
Which I presume is a parody of sci-fi
Though I haven't watched it
Kinda
They're all just comic books
I've fucking seen it asshole
Who knew books had good characters and plots
Jesus you where there for 15 minutes of it
I give you harsh, critical and witty commentary
I'm not talking to you idiot
Obviously
It would have been pretty hard not to know you watched it
I'm in a lecture stop blowing up my beeper
You'd have to pay me enough money to put a deposit on a decent house in the south of the country to get me to watch all of marvels stuff
No I wouldn't
I bet I could do it for nearly free
Then I'm not watching it
Nop
Not willingly
So guys, how about a film night
Not on Halloween cunt
Hell, let's make it a regular thing
I'm down
As long as it isn't marvel
Then each week, we can take turns picking a film
So it's fair
Does that mean we have to go to fucking reading every week
Dude idk
It was kind of a bit
Because that rabbit thing was horse shit btw
Each fucking week
Yeah I got that
Not even with my railcard am I willing to travel that often
I went to Oxford once
Someone sat next to me on the way back
I didn't like that
It meant I couldn't look in that direction at all
Hah
I think I'm gonna bring a big bag with me and put it on the window seat and sit on the aisle seat when I go on the train from now on
Like a bag too big for the overhead storage
Golf caddy
I'm gonna take a golf caddy everywhere on the train with me
I just fucking stand like a man
I did that when I went to college
But other people do that
So if you don't have a book or something it's really awkward
Why would you pick the aisle seat
Because if you pick the window seat and put your bag on the aisle seat I reckon it's more likely someone will see it's free and ask you
You're a complete bitch
No I just think unnecessary social interactions like that are inefficient
True I'd rather not have someone ask for the seat because I'm a complete bitch, but also because it's a waste of energy to be stressed about something that could have been prevented but wasn't because you were too scared about coming across as a complete bitch
I just stand
And I urge you to reconsider
Purchase a golf caddy
Also get those four seater table spots on the train
And empty your bag over the table as soon as possible so nobody wants to deal with that shit
Even better put a bunch of magnets out on the table so no fuckers can get their laptops out without destroying them
Dress up as a bomb
I just realised if I blow myself up in a big crowd then nobody will even want to go near me
Incorrect
There's a whole kink for that
No way
I just want to be unique
And uninteresting
And rich
Alright sociopath
Is that too much to ask
Tom
Can I have all of your money please
And you isaac
If you don't mind
Only if you pay it back within 6 months
Otherwise there's interest
Even though you clearly already can't pay
I'll just hold on to it for you
I've had 2 emails today
One an automated reminder email
Zadie Smith is a hypocrite
The other an email from reception to everyone here about Christmas plans for closing businesses etc
Who the fuck that is
How can she demand her community remove themselves from critical reading in order to achieve a claim to objectivity, but then draw on anecdotal experiences to suggest the importance of her style of reading
Typical
Her literary essay only makes the controversy around Hurston's novel even worse
Doesn't it just
Seriously this bitch is only contributing to the divide that's tearing Harlem away from white new York
This is why we need Luke Cage
Couldn't agree more
Luke cage get in here
Tbh Jane Hurston isn't as bad as Joseph Conrad
Oh dont get me started on Joseph
But she threw away a golden opportunity to progress Black civil rights a decade before the rest of society would catch up
So bad
Conrad was never in that position
Indeed
This kind of devalues the idea that Chinua Achebe is the only living author actually allowed to critique novels that challenge black stereotypes
Even he had his flaws
The problem is that many throw out critical analysis simply because they can identify with the writing
Just because someone writes about stereotypes doesn't mean they're giving a critical commentary on them
Yes but you can forgive him for being the only living author actually allowed to critique novels that challenge black stereotypes
What a guy
What are you taking about btw.
I think the most important lesson Zadie had taught so far is that reading is not neutral or unbias
All readers are positioned, either by the author or themselves
Is Zadie from Earth?
Personal experience can't be separated from objective critique
Holy fuck just because she's black you prick
Hey good you can still have a two way convo
That was the most interesting lecture so far
And it was about the blacks
My phone recognises my face when I'm rubbing my eye
Spooky

That's a good one
Hah
Yeah it is
A Scottish lad with bright purple hair just told me I need counselling
Nice
What's his name
I don't know
We refer to him as purple dude
Fucks sake I hold mulenga defrost some bread for me and the prick roasted it
I take it all back, harlem needs burning
Defrosting bread is hard
He put the microwave on to the full power and then screamed 'Wakanda forever!'
Defrosting bread is hard
What fucking nonsense
Step 1
Take it out the freezer
Step 2
Come back in a day
Oh yeah I can wait a day to have a swandwhich and watch my bread go moldy
Well if you can't do that then what exactly is the point of bread
the next chat should be called the point of bread
man I wish I could play an instrument
!news
what the fuck does digs in mean
in that context
!news
that's a weird picture
Nah that's a fine picture
Better finish this chat up boys
We've got a while to go yet
Not if I pin everything
I dare you
That's against the rules
Whew
I've been typing that for the last 10 minutes
Well done
Ty
This work whatsapp chat
They're literally just sending pictures of shits to each other
For fucks sake
You ever been on BBC good food
You ever look as the SIMPLE and EASY recipes
Yeah maybe it would be simple if I was a fucking sous chef with a literal bucket of fucking cash and a fucking warehouse full of exotic fruit and fish
Spag bol just isn't on there
I couldn't fucking think of a more SIMPLE and EASY recipe
Red berry fruit compote (German rote grütze)
Ever seen a hello fresh advert
Oh shit there's something I could cook in bulk and then eat across the next 4 days
No I haven't but it can't be worse than this shit
That fucking guy
Just look it up
Asian prawn & quinoa salad
Couldn't just have a basic fucking salad
Naaah it ain't simple till you add fucking quinoa to the title
Smoked salmon adds a new twist to this kedgeree - it's perfect for Saturday brunch
Tell me
Tell me how that fits the requirements for EASY and SIMPLE
A real kid pleaser!
Well isn't that nice

Beans on toast
I only eat sun dried tomatoes dude
If you can stand the challenge
The idea that anything other than the sun has dried my tomatoes is honestly fucking sick
What if they went at them with a blow drier?
What the fuck has society come to
*it is special because you get a juicy flavour coming from the beans while eating the toast*
Mark, aged 6
Why does everything need a gadamn twist
I don't want my food to have a twist in it
I want it to sustain my life
That's all
Then why are you looking at a recipe websitr
Make some fucking toast
Because I need some variety in my diet
That's the point of cooking different food
I have three fucking recipes in my head and that would be fine
Toast has plenty of variety
But they're all just based on mince
Oh fuck you
You're a useless cunt go get cancer in your fucking anus you git
I just might
But I'll survive
From my balanced toast diet
It's a shame I don't have a Cuban grandmother to pass down recipes
My grandma makes an amazing lemon drizzle cake
No savoury stuff though
Oh and a treacle sponge
And brownies
And ginger biscuits
How is there a rice called risotto rice?
Why can't there just be rice
And shortbread biscuits with a tiny bit of custard powder in which gives it a much richer flavour
You go to the store and get a bag of rice
A fucking big bag that'll last you the rest of the decade if you want
I have to go shopping now and look for fucki g risotto rice
Why is there anything, tim
Fuck off
What are we all here for
I'm practically suicidal
I'm more suicidal than you!
Chestnut mushrooms?
Surely I can use just normal mushrooms
Yeah probably
Also risotto rice is bigger, so it can soak up flavor more like pasta than rice
It's official
My leave requests were accepted
I'm off on Monday and the first week of december
Fuck off the boy Lucas already informed me
I am happy more again
How come my phone won't fit on this
What does thread stuck in device driver even mean
There's a thread stuck in the device driver
I'm living with an autistic
He just smashed libbys only plate
With a bottle of tobasco
that's impressive if anything
like
he smashed a plate with a tobasco bottle?
those things are tiny
We were talking smack about him just before he came in
He burnt his bacon to a crisp, and then we had to ask him to wash up the condiments he had left after using both in the sink and his cupboard because the room stank so much
Then he smashed libbys only fucking plate and left
He also supports ukip
wow
what an individual
He likes to have loud phone calls watching loud tv at loud 2 in the morning
Me and mulenga mulenga of wakanda share both share a wall with him
wtf
Haha dude when Ben burnt his bacon I said 'wow it's darker than mulenga'
Hahaha
jesus christ dude
Ikr
what is going on in reading rn
Lots of drugs
A couple rapes
And some very scared Asians
this is why I don't watch the news
Oh and Anne-marie will be doing a show here on the 6th of June next year
Just saying lads
I can only assume that is purposefully vague
Let's not be hasty
!define vague
wtf
that ain't no verb chief
presumably thread stuck in device driver means that in the program your computer uses to allow your operating system to communicate with a specific physical piece of hardware, there's a process that is running that has got into a loop or some other situation whereby it cannot continue
question was "when's radiohead's next uk tour"
Shit, I forgot we were going to wales next year

Holy shit there are ddifficulties?
yeah
two of the three have time limits
Is there an easy?
Awww fuck thaaay

the 'easy' is meant for short runs I guess
which is weird
i go hard in the motherfucking paint
NIGGAH
Lol you remember when that dude burnt his bacon and I compared it to the resident negro
I've killed 3 bosses so far, and they are such bullshit
wow
i dont think i completed a single area
oh they're not at the end of the areas
they're just sort of sprinkled throughout
oh
they have their own missions
then youre not very good are you
fuck off
they're at the end of the level
i kind of feel like were not even talking about the same game
it feels a little like that
i was talking about a rap song by the way guys
do you like rap songs?
yeah thanks Jamie
well ive discussed it with my fellows, and rap is dead right now
only british rap is any good, because black people struggle to articulate themselves
but not grime
grime is bullshit
also dont listen to any other genre especially pop
its made to *sell*
and its honestly repulsive
i think art should be free
unless its british rap
because oh god i wish i was a british rapper
Eminem made the Venom theme song
i wish i was jon anderson
for the new movie
out in cinemas now
didnt everyone die though?
in what?
the universe dipshit
keep up
oh
so far yeah
haven't quite pinned down that one
but we're getting there
so the next spiderman movie should be ready rad huh
yeah it's been ready for a while
since before infinity war was actually
kinda why he's in that movie huh
well thats gonna break the fucking immersion
just be ready to jack off to captain marvels fucking tits you incel cuck
look dude, Ant Man and the Wasp weren't even in the fucking movie, and they had their own movie come out since
well i guess they were unscathed then
stop defending their shitty schedule you marvel cocksucker
what?
it's just set before it anyway
all I'm saying is
you should've watched Spiderman Homecoming
and Guardians of the Galaxy 2
and Thor Ragnarok
and Black Panther
dude fuck off
that would've done it
maybe if they had released any of this in order
maybe then
im fucking sick of directors tearing my life apart and spinning me in circles
what?
in order?
ant man is the only one off
what are you even trying to say
what are you trying to say?
What I'm trying to say is... I'm hungry!
have you created a french globe yet?
or is that nuisance UN getting in the way still
dont fucking talk like you know
im done
with that game?
for at least another week
well good
I was under the impression that CK2 was somewhat superior
all paradox games are equal under god
so why haven't you played Magicka
cause that sounds like same gay nerd shit
and ck2 doesn't
I don't mean to play devil's advocate, but I'm not sure you get to judge that jamie
you telling me crusader kings doesn't sound like some gay nerd shit?
I'm saying you literally refuse to play games with Dragon in the title
jamie your cat is going to go missing tonight
name one good game with dragon in the title
i'll wait
Jamie I can name so many
but you'll just disregard them like a bastard child in the 900s
excuses excuses
go play dragonquest
Dragon Quest is a game
I played Dragon Quest 9
yes i know
on the DS
not bad
incorrect
see
the 900s?
what the fuck
well I figured Willy did some shit in the 1000s
which might have slightly moved opinion
not fully
but a little
and I wanted the full disregard
okay you are not on first name terms with King William de Normandie
oh you're using the fucking french conjunctive now are you
Dragon Age
Dragon Age 2
Dragon Age Inquisition
Dragon's Dogma
is 4 enough?
4 what
fucking games asshole
4 shitty games with dragon in the title?
no way dude
Jamie you haven't even played any of them
not a single one
yeah but they have dragon in the title so i know they're shit
and this is supposed to defy my original point how?
i can't remember your original point
did you even make one
that you outright refuse to play games with Dragon in the title, therefore rendering your opinion on a game's name's nerdiness biased
name one good game with dragon in the title
i'll wait
fine, wait
exACTLy
youre not waiting
when a good dragon game comes out i'll stop waiting
but in the meantime
you know what fine
that's next on the list
im gonna live a long, full life of proper games
expect a ludicrous halloween of gifted games Jamie
they better not fucking be dragon games
directly after we establish how I can watch them
they're ALL gonna be dragon games Jamie
more than you thought were possible
more than you can even delete from your library
go to your library and find the game you hate the most
now try and delete it
delete the game isaac
and maybe while youre at it you can eat some glass
would it be a problem if that game was Kingpin
no
i have more copies
hah
isaac your cat is going missing tonight
nigga you in reading
and your car is going to be in missing
well that's an actual crime
so is that screenshot
well let me apologize sincerely
although is any apology truly sincere?
can people really *change*?
only as sincere as the missing persons report youll have to file for your cat
that would be
a hell of a day in the office
yeah well maybe I'll just file your cat instead
you ever notice how chips tasted better in the 80s?
I have

I think there is
you ever get spasms in your eyelids?
only when assholes the other side of the country threaten to steal my fucking pet
I don't think that's a contributing factor
but thank you for your concerns in the issue

ParanormalDate match: I also like

Hope that clears things up for you

My seminar lecturer is called John Scholar
He was born on January 3rd
He shares that date with his dad
Good for them
He's from London
He tried to get into the Sopranos, but run out of steam after season 2
It's because it was too violent for him
Also my friend is an ordained priest
Does he do birthdays
Watch what you say
If he performs a marriage it's legally binding
Bullshit
Priests do the ceremony
He has a certificate Jamie
He refuses to pay the charge for having it printed
But even still
You can't marry without signing a document
Priests don't do documents
Unless they're restraining orders
I'll forge your signature
You haven't got a clue what my signature looks like
Fine I'll just forge your cat
My cat would rip you apart

you're looking rather plateresque this fine hour
whos that
you look like an extra in a marilyn manson music video
Lul
the last bus from Banbury to Deddington is at 7:20pm
what are you saying
that if i want to go somewhere far away I need to be back in banbury by roughly seven
so you're not stranded in cirencester then
wtf is cirencester
sounds like a circus act
it's a city
i believe it is between here and bristol
right, and the fact that the last bus leaving from banbury to arrive in deddington is at 7, could have only meant I was stranded somewhere other than banbury
isaac i'm not a fucking investigative journalist
my ideas don't have to be based on pure unadulterated logic
I would like to hear your 'adulterated' logic then
!define adulterated
ok
my adulterated logic would be that you must be in north korea
because whatever logic that would compel me to derive that you were sending me messages on discord from north korea remarking about the bus times between deddinton and banbury, would definitely have been dicked around with etc.
wonderful
gonna be visiting london soon
nice
what you gonna do in london
London is shit
oh lighten up cunt
It's like Reading but worse
OH FUCK OFF Jamie
go to sleep
This is what I've been saying for years
Everyone but me is depresses
London is no worse than reading
i just wanted to talk to isaac about his upcoming trip to london
if anything London is just a higher class reading

I can't even talk to you you're so bad at grammer
!markov
YOU'RE FUCKING LISTENING TO THAT SONG STILL
!MARKOV
well maybe if you listened to it you would understand
*maybe*
i did
Can't even understand what you're saying
i can't remember it
Every fucking word was wrong
!quote
!markov
there
different song
i don't know what to say
also my amazon recommended items are a bikini and a vibrator rn
tell me about it
last two things I bought on amazon were a backpack and a comb
there's an actually different song
yeah because anyone who buys a fucking USB-B to USB 2.0 cable is a fucking business
you should change your name to Business
Business Hoad
also you're just listening to that REM album
i saw a music video of theirs that i liked today
so i'm listening to their entire discography
what was the video?
imitation of life
oof
saw that one in secondary school
during assembly
really
yeah
fucking Tustain or something
oh god
whoever the bald one was
one of those two
oh no that wasn't tustain
he was
uhh
yeah I know
I meant it was one or the other
yeah him
spock
hah
bald spock
bus checker spock
oh no wait he didn't play spock
what's his name
leonard nimoy?
well yeah that's spock
no shit
the one patrick stewart played
what?
patrick stewart in star trek
whats the character
picard
jean luc
thats it
him
but more nasal
alright
none of this is his actual name
names are just
names
are just
names are etc.
anyway he showed you that music video
why on earth
did he want you to be mesmerised or something
Don't you hate it when lollipops have a bunch of hollows
I already knew the song
He just decided to open up the assembly with it once
wait
no he didn't
it was losing my religion
oh right like how mr farmer just decided to open up the assembly with that poem about the WWI soldiers that one time
I watched the Imitation of Life one by myself
have you seen the Bad Day one?
oh shit I know 4 REM songs!
no i haven't
!
yeah it's pretty good too
my amazon recommendations
not as interesting as yours
i got acoustic guitar bridge pins
and a 3.5mm to 6.5mm audio jack adapter
so all guitar stuff
the audio jack adapter isn't really guitar stuff
i mean i don't know why it was even recommended to me
i don't need it]
or the fucking bridge pins
who plays acoustic guitar these days
pussies
that's who
well believe it or not, I don't need a bikini or a vibrator
so it's to be expected
but you could make a vibrating bikini
ah im saving that thought
oooook
that was a joke isaac
probably already a thing anyway
i don't doubt it
you know what you do doubt
theism
that I would remember this:

oh shit dude
going on like 2 months now?
keep it up
I'll try
until I buy it or something
i'd like to think it's been in your clipboard this whole time
so would I
we all tell ourselves happy lies
I think it's better in text form
on reflection i am inclined to concur
not sure why
I guess its less obvious
has less of the tongue-in-cheek vibe that the illustrations carry
which in turn makes it funnier
yeah it's more slapstick
must be why there was so much slapstick but it was all shit
looks better on paper
dude you watch monty python
monty python transcends comedy dude
it's like a subreddit about itself
I think it blends comedies
but it's definitely part slapstick
tbf I've only really watched the movies
you're missing out
the sketch show was the best
I just have so much stuff I want to watch
I feel like the newer stuff is more relevant
depends what crowd you want to mingle with
I guess so
A crowd of less irritating mes would be nice
maybe they could teach me something
i wouldn't get on with myself
Hahah
You're so right
the more i watch of red dwarf the more i realise im literally rimmer
He's the lame one right
thanks isaac
thanks
yes
i'd rather be the cat
i think i have an eye for fashion
oh yeah
your double denim was rocking the streets of banbury
bet you didnt notice the universal swooning withing a radius of about 500m wherever i walked around
not just women either
you were prepared because i told you beforehand
but
well i mean you remember that chatty guy who was probably high
my fashion drove him nuts
oh christ
I'd forgotten
ffs
kind of how I imagine that guy Tom keeps talking about
the one that waits in the kitchen
hah yeah i suppose
why do my new chrome windows open at half height
He's never high
He just fucks
Get your fax straight
not that bit
*oo look at me with my chrome windows im so rich*
the bit where he waits for attention
or any social contact whatsoever
I drank his lemon juice 😉

Told me not to tell anyone about it and acted all serious about it
So I'm curious what's happened
I go take a look
One of the receptionists drove the wrong way in our brand new one way system for like 3 seconds to take a shortcut to her parking space
Big fucking deal
Oh don't get me started on the fucking French
We're not
Shut up
You don't have to go back all that far

For fucks sake Felix is actually on my floor
what's his full name
He's in the kitchen opposite ours but it's just out of the wall a bit
Felix is apparently playing cod rn
If we're both on the sofa we can awkwardly make eye contact
Well evidently fucking not isaac
But he's been playing it all day
Or maybe it's in the kitchen
I think he just leaves it on
For like, days
I can sympathise with that
He's at the main menu rn
Are your stalking him?
PlayStation makes it really easy
Hey Jamie you busy?
Not really

As if Aldi can make anything better than egg cress bloody sandwiches
i'd take an egg cress bloody sandwich over your laptop
Well, then you'd get ill
your laptop is making me ill
Tell me about it
Tbf I tried to open four things at once
But I might have to kill it

You really need a guide for blue shift
what is blue shit
It's a game
yeah but
what does it do
Oh isaac I didn't realise you'd played all the way through with your eyes closed
Looks like a good guide though
Yeah you should give it a read
link me up bb
https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Opposing_Force

i haven't even fully played half life 2
I haven't even played half life 3
well you *are* you
you know what did need a guide
fucking kingpin
I need to e-mail a gardener
Don't know why you're telling me
I'm not Doctor Rosenburg
who is?
I'll give you one guess
Doctor Rosenburg

I could run uncontested for several positions in RUSU
what's rusu
oh
nevermind i worked it out

Radiohead
stop fucking saying radiohead
Radiohead
im going to fucking kill you
and get away with it
stream it
for the prime sub dollars Jamie
and if that means training to be a doctor and waiting until you're 86 then so be it
I'm imagining the emotes already
man talking heads is really not my thing
what a surprise
i mean it's better than everything on radio 1
and most of the stuff on radio 2
Well that would be a crime
it's about on par with radio 6
radio 6?
isnt that classical?
no that's radio 3
i think
ffs
can't they just have names
radio 6 is indie and old
it's my favourite bbc radio station
but that's not really saying much
i hate the radio
i'd rather have full control over what i listen to
and control of the autobahns
<:hitlerjamiebaewowwtf:317778075033141248>

dude wtf
is even going on anymore
it's a slow burner
it's very catchy
All radiohead is trash
i don't particularly like the ska style
or reggae whatever it is
so is your face
huh
how's that
but it catches on
Fuck off you fat fuck
albeit quite slowly
shit
got me
too bad i'm ploughing through REM and Mike Oldfield at the same time
ew
gonna have trouble listening to three discographies simultaneously
No your music taste is worse
As is your taste in food, clothes and air
Get fucking real shitcake
you live in reading
hah
nice taste in cities
man, never heard someone rag on locale
You earn 5.33 an hour
Nice taste in job
and how much do you earn per hour?
8.50 but it'll go up to 8.70 I  november
oh so you got your tesco job then
I didn't lose it dumbass
I've still got a nifty 3 hour contract
you haven't moaned about tesco in like 5 weeks
Yeah well here's a moan
oh that explains why they're paying you so much by the hour
They sent me a new contract for study leave to my old address
I'm not working those three hours in case you're confused
That's just what I'm required to work when I come home
so they're still paying you?
No
me neither
in case you forgot
tried twice though
so that's great
Yeah I don't know what you're doing tbh
well I'm burning through Darkest Dungeon rn
I meant in an interview
Apparently you don't do yourself any favours
Or so I've heard
oh yeah, I was supposed to e-mail him back
and ask for feedback
it's not like I'm in there dissing myself
in the process of explaining a bit of music theory to my mother i have managed to get fucking Wonderwall into my head
I'm really trying to advertise my skills
but clearly it's not good
especially at fucking tesco
I just wanna be like, I can definitely do anything this job may require of me, and almost certainly more
but that's not gonna work
You didn't shit yourself or something did You?
they didnt ask me to do that so I didn't
Woah
Are you suggesting that if they had you would have
that was the comedic implication yes
but actually that would be really difficult
That was the comedic implication
but yeah, I never did e-mail them back
I'm not even sure how I would adapt to their feedback
although it's unlikely they'll respond
Well I guess since you don't have their feedback you probably can't
must be
I don't like that my worms are in sync
Have you applied elsewhere
Maybe Tesco just doesn't need someone with your particular skillset
all the job required was fucking reading
if anything I'm, somehow, grossly overqualified
Yeah that's why it's surprising
idk dude
I'm gonna check out some other options first
maybe look at some learning courses for weirdly specific stuff
I figure those have got to be an easy in
not that the course is easy necessarily
Hey I'm learning weirdly specific stuff
yeah alright dude
but what you're aiming for is a varied knowledge
i've heard that learning a trade like plumbing or electricing can get you the big bucks
fuck that
i might do that
haven't you got like a qualification or something now?
Haha
i have a btec or somehting like that in technology shit
dafuq is a btec
no idea what that means
great
well it can go on the cv I guess
apparently it's equivalent to an a-level
Btec is for retards
No offence
have fun with your mince diet then Tom
Fucking retard
Bitch I just ate a rissoto
Have fun with still being fat
hahahah
but yeah my working theory is that people are more likely to hire someone who can also fix computers because then they don't have to hire someone specifically to fix their computer
THE RISOTTO DIDN'T HAVE MINCE IN IT
yeah I figured
I'm sick of people shit talking me
im about to munch a fuckin 150g doritos bag
Apparently Anna was spouting all this shit about 'ew Tom was microwaving bread in here yesterday'
Listen up arseholes there's no mince in my risotto and the bread need defrosting
the thing with people is
about 60% of them are arseholes
now there are factors that change that percentage
*CYNICISM*
and I can't speak for how universities manage
but my instinct would be *big increase*
then again
a lot of arseholes are dumb
so what do I know
The person I like least here is autistic
The other 8 people either keep to themselves entirely or go out of the way to be nice in front of me
There was the matter of the spilt milk, but we got over that
As a fucking T.E.A.M
Hey maybe I'm an arsehole
what does that stand for
But in that case you must be an arsehole
Tom Eats Ass Monthly
Facebook
i don't even drink tea
i've made tea about twice in my life
and i know that you put milk in first
what a stupid fucking question
Yeah you're more of a LET'S GET RAGGED type of guy
yeah i do like to be ragged
gross
!define rag
hahahah
I don't know why I found that last bit so funny
What the fuck
Benjamin is outside pretending he's a drill sergeant in front of 6 other guys
They're all playing along
He's just marching them all over the car park
maybe he's a wizard
He's got a fucking gun
probably a Slytherin
He's genuinely autistic
I think maybe hufflepuff
wow rude
Isaac if he marches his boys in here I've got nothing
I could barricade myself in the kitchen but there's too much glass
does your bed go all the way down?
What the fuck does that even mean?
can you hide underneath?
I guess but if have to move my dildo collection
You're not thinking practically
Oh fuck is he loud
is he dressed up?
or are they just fucking plastered
I mean it's 11pm it's not a thing
He doesn't fucking drink isaac
He's sober
Oh god he's coming
well, larping
I'm going to fucking die in here
still a weird time
you definitely do not have enough clothes to prevent you from hiding in there
the closet that is
That's be great if there weren't draws in there
dude there's enough space
push comes to shove most people are uncomfortable with unwarranted nudeness
Hold on they've got a black guy
That's not fair
home invasion isn't exactly a sport
He chose the worst fucking night there's barely anyone else here
the luck of the irish
*autistic
They might not all be sober
yeah it's not exactly a regular thing to do
jesus christ that is a lot of bad cider
They also popped all of Lucas's balloons lol
Anna set those up for his birthday and they all ended up in Ben's cupboard
This explains the popping noise
They were just firing there guns wildy at my door
who the fuck buys those fucking one piece chairs
they're so fucking uncomfortable
Guys both Anna's are in here
Apparently they puked in everyone's toilets
And the girls are freaking the fuck out
Oh
That's unfortunate
We cleaned up his mess

You can’t eat a bunch of chips and call it dinner man you just can’t do that. It’s just a snack. You missed dinner just admit it. Chip dinner is fake.
what if you're a vegetarian getting fish and chips
Do you want unsolicited pictures of my penis?
I had burger and chips for dinner
I've wanted a burger all fucking day
why are you even asking that tom
if i said yes then they wouldn't be unsolicited
if you're gonna send me unsolicited pics then why ask
I'm just saying don't ask stupid questions
It's like having a rape fetish
But toned down
ah yes that's what i was just thinking

yes of course

Only Holland stayed in tonight, and he's on the phone to his servant
I wouldn't want to interrupt

I'm sure there's someone in fiverr for that
ON

Christ

I just got home
It's fucking raining let me tell you
Yeah I had to dry the cat
Hah, not easy
He loves it
Yeah?
Mine doesn't
He really does
Hahah
Ginger cars are from another planet
Mine just gradually moves further and further away every time I try and towel him
Until he's underneath something
Oh yeah mine does that too but he still purs like a bitch
I think it's just a reflex cats have to move forward when you touch their sides
I've mastered this art and can steer my cat anywhere
Hah
Mine is sitting on me rn
He has like 4 modes
Hungry, sleepy, playful and starey
Mainly those first two
I'm just thinking about how many modes mine has
I think it's the same but he also has a talkative mode
Usually when he comes in from outside and tells us all about it
And you can talk back to him and he'll meow back
Hahah, yeah I get that sometimes, mainly when I'm in the kitchen though
Near his food bowl
does he ever silently enter the room and stare at you from behind
and then you turn round and you have no idea how long he's been there staring at you
Sometimes, but whenever I pay him attention after that he just tries to get me to follow him to the food
He pretty much begs for food for half of his waking hours
But he's still overweight
A little
wilbur's worked out that zoe and i feed him less than our mum, so he can pretend to be much hungrier than he really is and trick us into giving him food early
he might just be hungry but idk
then if i don't feed him straight away he climbs on my desk and stands in front of the screen like "ooh whats that, and whats that, and that"
Mine does the same thing, my brother gives him breakfast then he comes up to me and pretends he hasn't had it yet
Although he hasn't caught any birds recently
I guess it's lame weather for it
Stays inside most of the time, sitting on us
i don't think i've ever seen a cat catch a bird
i've never had one young enough to be bothered
It's not even raining you pussy
fuck off to booking
reading
wahtever
Hah
i'd love to see some kind of animation of a cat jumping 20 feet and catching a bird out of the air
because that's how i visualise it
Hah

I'm scared to leave my room because the cleaning lady is scrubbing her way through my pee stains
you have a cleaning lady?
Oh you think I'm elitist
Back in Wakanda mulenga had servants in his mansion
i don't think you're elitist
i'm just wondering why you have a cleaning lady
Because I'm not cleaning Ben's poops nor am I emptying a 3 bins I don't use regularly when they are full of boozes and other people's ready meal wrappers
Also the uni doesn't trust these kids to keep halls clean, so they send in squads to each building to maintain order

gee Jamie, you really cut up this one
i figured out how to get it to try again if it doesn't work the first time
so i can make the expectations higher
except now it's at risk of running out of tries
that last error i got was because it tried 10,000 times and couldn't make anything
so i bumped that up to 100,000

That wasn't worth the wait
Yeah well the only way to make it quick is by saving the previous 15,000 messages in a text file and have it reference that instead of requesting the data from discord every time
Which is what it does with the pins
But 15,000 messages in a text file
The free tier Amazon server has about 30GB of storage
You're clearly not committed to this
About 20GB of which is taken up by the operating system
I can try
When I'm bored
Well I'm bored now
I mean not yet
!markov
There's also a big problem with !quote not updating when stuff is pinned which stems from the bot having no idea which channel is the current channel
Actually hold the fuck up Jamie in the future look at this with the module exports thing you k what I m

not with the response that's still garbage

I think we just need a more balanced composition of garbage and sense
Because it's always going to be somewhat trash
!markov
yeah i don't want it to spit out sentences that make perfect sense
but i also don't want it to be repetitive or insignificant
so ive just found a way to control the minimum amount of samples it takes
however i notice this is taking longer than usual
i might have pushed it too far
nevermind i paused it by clicking somewhere on the console screen
how stupid
Kinda like that time we stole our neighbour kitchens mop

yours is happening now
i can see it in the cmd
and if i put my dick in the bot, will that show up in the cmd
i didn't know you felt that way about Lean Pepperoni
when you do !markov
there's about 15 seconds of 10-20% cpu usage while it gathers the previous 15,000 messages
and then there's what we're experiencing now
100% cpu usage for however long it takes for it to create a sentence that is between 10 and 15 words long, made of at least 8 different source messages, all linked together by two words, all of which has a score higher than 100
no idea what the score is btw
!markov
!markov

!markov
what would you say is the average message length in these channels
do you think it's below 800 characters
because
if so
i reckon it could all be stored in a file
and that would speed it up like lance armstrong in the tour de france

oh shit once i have it all in a file i could buffer like 5 or 6 so it's instant

Hey at home I get 70-80mbs^-1
See this other site says I got 90 and a ping of 75
75 gigaseconds
Why is it connecting me to a server in manchester
How is that shit fair
Lol 75 gigaseconds is almost 2500 years
You think every website you visit has a server in the uk
You probably go a lot further than Manchester usually
Reading is the centre if everything internet and everybody knows it
Please
Reading books
If that isn't the name of a library or bookshop in reading btw I'm claiming it
Gonna make a chain with a festive dinner preparation shop in Turkey
And a restaurant in Hungary
Jack and I are taking the exact same 6 modules and don't share a single seminar together
And a warm coat manufacturer in west South america
And no but there's Reading Bedding
Almost punched the wispy bearded fuck in there
But he was actually an alright dude
There's no Reading Books?
I might as well quit right now and get a train down there
Snap up a plot and start nicking books from university libraries and selling them
Owning a bookshop would actually be really cool
Somebody said I'd make a good librarian the other day
I mean what the fuck
I think you would actually
I can see you as a librarian
Going on rants about how much rape there is in that Tess of the durberbilles book
Why does any text ever have to be this fucking big
Dont even
Durberbilles
Fuck me lengthways
Blame phone
Maybe so that they catch out the lawyers reading the small print
So they miss the big print
How do you get from this to that
Man that kid on the left looks a right nonce
The twat wearing the quicksilver shirt?
What even is that
Do you know what left is?
Did You mean my left?
You with ear length hair looks like me with ear length hair
Well
Back then
Bro what the fuck
You look like 3 year old me?
Come on you should take that as a compliment
I meant 3 year old me looked like 3 year old you
I bet us as 3 year olds would have gotten along
Such a shame that you wouldn't be born for several more years
What are you getting at
Several more weeks more like
Actually what
No
What I'm tryna say is... I'M HUNGRY!
Oh and that John Scholar has got my fucking back
Also dude John Donne
This fucking legend
You should come to my restaurant in Hungary then
He was a player during the renaissance
He always fucked
John fucking scholar
Is that his actual name
And he compared it on his poetry to being bitten by a flea
He used maths and science in his romantic poetry
And irregular rhyme and rythmn to the extent that people wanted to kill him for 'buthering' contemporary style
This was of course until he got caught fucking several members of his boss's family
So then they made him Dean of St Paul's cathedral
Which kinda made him a downer actually
"You pull me towards you like the sum of an infinite series of fractions where the denominator increases by 1 in each element pulls towards 1"
He started making ridiculously obscure metaphors based on outdated models of science to explain his religious views
Yeah kind of like that but with less rythmn
LESS rythym?
Oh and yeah the guys name is John Scholar
He was born on January 3rd
Same date as his father
Wow fucked that gode speling up
He's married, has 3 kids
And he couldn't get through the Sopranos because it was too violent
He often thinks about having an official birthday like the queen in summertime
"The kissing number of a sphere is 12 but ours is infinite"
I'm not going to stop btw
https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46467/the-flea
Well I'm pausing until I think of another one
The dudes a fucking riot I tell you
Or was until the fucking clergy got him
He was supposedly protestant as well
The fuck does he have against Maidenhead
Who the fuck knows, it was a crazy time
"The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that any positive integer except 1 can be written as a unique product of its prime factors, wanna bang?"
Something something unique product
Fucking hell I've got to call Lenovo
Wow jamuel, you gonna publish that one
Here's one
"Wanna be sexy primes?"
!markov
I can't actually remember what sexy primes are but I know they exist
I think it's something like a pair of primes separated by 6
Yep that's it
5 and 11
Is an example
Uhh
Bit young may be
Ditto
Ok hold on
How about 151 and 157
Ahh
I mean
Fuck
Well it's not too young
So my options are children or bones
There's quite a few in between
You couldn't just cut a guy some slack on the whole 'consent' issue?
23 and 29
Too old
7 and 13
Dude the number of underage cock on grindr is unreal
The only sexy prime for 19 is 13
And that is weird Tom
Not my fault
I was being tapped pretty hard last night
17 and 23
Aw dude you're pretty smart
You should try a maths course or something
Yeah, then I could become an accountant
!
Does you last name end in 'berg'?
Tim Bradleyberg
Does your dick smell of clove?
I have no idea what that means
Garlic presumably
I think it probably smells of heavy duty febreeze but you're welcome to check
Is there such thing as heavy duty febreeze
Oh yeah dude
Why
I don't know where it ended up though
Because of people like Ben
Cooking raw ass chicken and then not washing anything
What's the point of having different potencies for covering up smells
Just throwing it back in the cupboard and reusing it
Just get the strongest one
It's not garlic
Yeah it's pretty strong though dude
I fucking dare you to inhale a couple lungfulls
I would
The febreeze
Not your dick
Trust me you don't have enough lung
Ggoodbye
I'm going to a lecture now

Everyone knows dragons are stupid
I bet your mother disagrees
I know damn well literature does
Literature can go fuck itself
In Reading
Red Dragon
A Hannibal novel
Probably shit
It has nothing to do with dragons
What's the stupid fucker calling it red Dragon for then
You'll have to *read it to find out*
#coolteachers
*why would I read a book with dragon in the name that isn't actually about dragons that I've never heard of and have no reason to read it*
It's about serial killers
More specifically ones that murder brutally
Wow at least they chose an original concept
And one of them has this whole Dragon complex
What he thinks he's a dragon?
Dragon cock
Oh fucking gid
Cock off back to your lecture
I'm swallowing so loudly
Everyone is silent
It's just the sound of my tongue slamming coffee down my throat
Hot
It's cold
And there's only 230ml
But by god is it going down slowly
Are all your lectures in massive halls with grandstands around a lower stage with a sliding board
Like I imagine it
We got two sliding boards
And yeah I'm in van edemt right now
And it's like a traditional theatre
But all the shitty modules are in classrooms
Fuckin sick dude
Oh
It encourages the lecturer to make you participate
I come here to be talked at for 50 minutes, and then I cam fuck off without expending any more energy
But some of these sick fucks get us doing squad work in a 9 am start
Oh they don't make you stand up in front of everyone do they?
I don't drink or stay up late and those still kill me
Nah
My first formative assessment will be 4 of us displaying a poster though
God
That takes me back to Phil and ethics
Yeah how does that help extract literature or language
The hardest part of my 500 word essay will be printing it off
The library is still accidently two buildings
Apparently a printer is a fire risk
Hey the fucking fire alarm in my halls went off yesterday and nobody reacted
Yeah I can type for hours about anything given a comfortable keyboard WHO DOESNT AUTOCORREXT EVERYTHING WRONG
Yeah that's awful here
Oh my god
Fire drill, nobody goes out because they don't want to be the first one
I think my lecturer died and wad replaced by a hot bearded dad
Nice
Yeah I was leaving anyway and don't care for my world possessions
Oh dude it's starting
Share the toys
Do you have like 3 lessons a day
Nvm, we're watching a Ted talk
No I have 50 mins today
This sounds incredibly laid back
I had two lectures yesterday plus a seminar
It's not man
I need 40 % to pass into next year
Not that that goes on my degree transcript
So really the aim is to do just enough work to get 40%
Yeah
Ngl first year is easier than a-level
No need to go above
I'd put that down to being able to do stuff in your own routine
This Ted talk is 20 minutes long dude
That's almost as long as one of my lecturers yesterday
I just watch ted talks in my own time
#hip
One of your lecturers was 20 mins long?
Ah well you should have paid 9 grand to do it with 200 other people
Yeah she couldn't get the DVD working so we just went home
I'm in a back row seat with one space around me in every direction
So how long is John scholar?
This is great
John Scholar is a seminar
If he's happy you can get a beefy hour out of him
We're discussing John Donne this week
John Donne Bovi

Oh boy Adichie not only write stupid African stories but also wrote 'We should all be femonists'

I'm gonna love this
"Stupid African stories"
And don't you forget it
Brilliant title though
I kinda want to hear a stupid African story
All of her early stories are really western
Check out Chinua achebe he's a great black guy
Is he dead
Oh no Adichie was so oppressed!
She had black servants though
A great black guy
That made me lagh
Hugely important in demonstrating African culture outside of post colonialism, but still exists in that subject
He also doesn't like the word nigger lol
Wow what a loser
He's one of the only black writers I know, and definitely the only black author I've read in any depth
It's interesting shit, but veeery african
What about jk Rowling
CONSPIRACY
And now we're talking about Joseph Conrad for fucks SAKE

I can't leave until the fucking spag bol is done
If this is adulthood then I want to go back
What are you eating it out of
A fucking plate believe it or not
Or my box idk
FINALLY
What
Spag bol is meant to be eaten from a plate
No shit?
What you doing about to put it in a bowl then
I just realised then how weird that would be
Also what fuckass cheapskate English student has 1 bowl
A poor one
And I wasn't going to put it in the bowl
I might have put my cereal in yhere
Ohh you poor poor university student
And it's useful for heating things up in the microwave
Oh Jamie

I haven't even paid for my accommodation
More than you make
I make 8.50

It's mentally taxing at first
And then it stays mentally taxing
Yeah dude
What I'm trying to say is
Try a 20 minute lecture
I'm great
I'd love a 20 min lecture
I don't think costcutter do bowls
It's run by Asians
Would you like to explain to a grumpy late 50s manager why his emails keep changing font sizes
Someone's gotta do it
I could never do what you do Jamie
Fucking never
Not even for 5.33 an hour?
If I can make more than that while on break at tesco I'm not sure it's even worth entertaining
Hey do you get paid to sit and do nothing for 9.5 hours
Easiest job I've ever had
Jesus Christ 9.5 hours
I want to know where my basil went
That photo doesn't do it justice, but someone's been at it
It'll still last me the next 3 years but that's not the point
Is that weed?
No he's out watching rugby
I haven't sat down in bloody hours
Sit down now then
I fucking can't Jamie I have to go buy a bowl
Actual the sheep shagger was kind enough to lend me one but I don't want to interact with him because his name has too many Ls in it
Sit down on the bus?
I'm not paying money to go to the shops
Is he called Llweellllynll
And they don't give change so I'd need exact change
No one ever has exact change
Your bus service doesn't give change?
That's bullshit
I can see a lawsuit
No bus in Reading gives change
There was an atm nearby when I tried to board one
But it only gave me 10s
The dude let me ride 'for free' in the end
That's ridiculous
Because you know everyone's paying with coins
They got the coins
You can pay by card
But only contactless
That is useless
That's cutting out a lot of people whose old cards haven't expired yet
Is reading Tory or Labour
It's shit
Tory
Figures
God I just want to moan a bit more about how fucking awful that is
Who runs the bus service
Is it a private company
Or is it the caahncil
It's actually probably to save time
Wouldn't want the bus drivers fumbling around for the right change
Except they're just bestowing that burden upon the customers who now have to root around in their small wallets and purses for exactly £2.73
Whereas on the bus the change can be sorted into containers that are easily accessible
And if they really want they can train their drivers on basic arithmetic
You can't do that for customers
So they're actually making it take longer by refusing to give change
God this is almost as bad as my grandad's idea to get rid of all money
Why has my bot stopped being called Fuddyduddy
It's only meant to change at midnight
I didn't restart it
Stupid thing
Someone be bored and angry with me
Reading is more likely labour
West reading is Tory apparently
And buses in central London only accept contactless
That's all I could find
I don't care where it happens it's still very stupid
It's infuriating
But exact change is nothing compared to that
My preferred mode of transport through central London is foot
Fuck you
I have a new bowl now
It's free
Fuck you
How much did that cost
A 5 pounds
Did they give you any change
Paid by card
Wow what cunts
The mild on the till smiled at me
That was priceless
MILF
I SAID MILF
Ohh right
Check out @KFC_UKI’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/KFC_UKI/status/1050352814805766146?s=09
So what have I done today
(To make me feeeeeel proud)
I got here early because it's Wednesday and my sister has college
Couldn't get in the door
Had to get someone to look at the lock
Then one of the receptionists needed a screen replacing
Then I asked a guy what the procedure is to send a laptop off for repair
Then the business park manager asked me to look into why his default outlook font keeps changing
That's literally everything I've done today
I haven't done anything else
Anyone want to go to canada
Yo your daughter goes to college?
I know it's hard to believe
What does she study?
Some girly shit
Make up and shit
Racist
And hair and shit
But she's also doing gcse maths and English
And shit
Fascinating shit
I shit you not
Jack doesn't have his maths gcse
And now he's studying literature at Reading
Kind of makes me feel like I didn't need to try so hard
How are his maths skills
Have you had a chance to tell
We both agree that letters and numbers should be separate but equal
That sounds dangerously close to racial segregation but for letters and numbers
Actually I guess the equal part is a bit different
Exactly
Blacks aren't inferior, but I don't want to have to share public transit with them
I'm glad we're on the same wavelength
No
We're really not

Every day of the week is a name
even Thursday?
Yes
why
Why is Arizona a name
Why is faith a name
there's a person called Arizona?
YES
There's almost certainly people called Texas
is there a person called New York State?
next thing you'll be telling me there's someone called Washington
ridiculous
i do not believe it

im just having this conversation with someone and i wondered what your answers would be
what would you do
if you broke all your limbs
and you were lying in the hospital bed
being jacked off by a gay male nurse without your consent
should have !markov working faster by end of tomorrow
if i remember to keep working on it
and if it goes to plan
!markov
My guilty pleasure is having all 4 limbs ripped off, my nose sawed off and my eyeballs taken out, and then some hunk of a dude just fucks my mouth relentlessly
Well if he's already jerking me off then I'm obviously already errect
So I can only assume I would ejaculate
The real question is what I'd do after
well answer that one then
I personally wouldn't want it going to waste
what's that supposed to mean
Idk
Cry
Tell someone
Tell no one
you're being too realistic
stop it
Jfc
Pussy
Eat it
yeah i thought that's what you meant
this syria documentary is really good
it's about the leader guy
beat vampyr
Is that the weird one
Where the protag has 3 eyes
!markov
Apparently weed didn't make the other corridor smell of weed
Security is upset
And this is my lunch
What
Oh I didn't see that last message
Nice
What're you having for lunch
The fuck is that
I just had a sandwich and a packet of crisps
Can you smell what the weed is cooking?
No I'm like 30 miles away
Reception just gave me a whole chocolate orange
You going to use it to hack into the mainframe?
Yeah if only I could just break this encryption field
Hold on gonna try rerouting the vector strings into the bit screens
Damn it they detected my digital footprint and shut off my server communications motherboard
*Enhance image*
Yeah that's him
I'm gonna take the piss so much when I tell him about that mustard stain on his collar
**No you're not, Jim**
Oh shit
They must have bugged our telemetric geolocators
I think I'll just call them
What the fuck are you on about
You're such bullshit
I was being every hacking scene ever
You couldn't hack my microwave if you *tried*
Bet I could
Go ahead punk
Does your microwave even have an ip address
Uhh
0
Are you fucking answering questions in binary now
Man I need to call Lenovo
Hanns-g
Your microwave isn't on the network
Because I'm off the grid
You'd need a fucking *thing* to connect it to the network so you could do shit like control it remotely
Like an apple pi or whatever they're called
Bramley's blackberry sigh
Oh shit there's a live chat
I don't have to call them
Whom
Lenovo
Wow
!wotd
!define camlet
!markov
!define doublet
!markov
God this live chat is amazing
So we have John here
With a female icon
And it says John (Listening)
And has done for about 5 mins
Even though I've already told him what's wrong
No reply
I went "hello?"
And BOOM
INSTANT SERVICE
!markov
!markov
I gotta do a shop
oh man
also that was a decent markov
Did You get a new bowl yet?
nope
it has to be very specific
Mine is ikea
But it's from the chink shop
are people allowed to resell ikea
you're missing the real point Jamie
do people *care*?
care about what
i don't care
what were you saying?
nevermind
do people care if you resell ikea
we still on that?
literally the last thing you said
pssshhh who cares
yeah whatever man
my shop's almost over
anything you guys need?
too late
don't cry to me when you run out of mustard
isaac would you please get me a pork roll egg and cheese if you please on a kaiser bun
I'm not in McDonald's jackass
Sainsburys don't sell that
is'ts a song dumbass
Sounds dumb
its ween
Perfect
Mustard is disgusting and so is sainsburys
I made a lot of enemies this week using my 20% off at tesco though
Wtf why
Haters gonna hate bro
when was the last time you pissed yourself
This morning
But it was in the shower
So it doesn't count
Stop bullying me
!markov
that isn't going to do anything for like an hour
i don't actually know how long it's gonna take
but it's not doing the normal thing
!quote
yeah that was gonna take waay too long
plan b
do it fucking better
that's good
I like that one
perhaps erasing and rewriting the file once for each of the 15,000 messages is gonna be a bit too inefficient

Eimaj
hey
Eimaj is a textiles business owner from azerbaijan
!markov
Sorry to hear this.
you should hear microsoft phone support
it's like they're contractually obliged to say you're most welcome sir whenever you say thanks
Yes quite, the temerity of them. Simply attrocious
scoff
well im fucking sorry isaac
Fuck off isaac
Belligerent little shit
sorry i get annoyed when someone takes up half the phone call worshipping me
I wasn't making a point against you
I just wanted to speak like a ponce
apologies if I insulted you
isaac you fucking brought my family to shame
hah
*A brack day*
am i meant to read that in a chinese accent
you can read it however you want
it's not going to make any sense to you regardless
but yes
you're right there
I've now spent 100 pounds on clothing
very good
why on earth
what d'you get
Pour moi Silhoutte velvet touch 50 denier tights
A black velvet skirt
A black phone light pad lace balcony bra
je ne ce'st quoi
or something
(My least favourite of the bunch)
And then a black thin strap vest
lotta black
*brack*
Not sure this outfit necessarily needs to be all that colourful
you going to a funeral?
What, dressed as a harlot?
how else would you attend a funeral
yes
I concur
need a red scarf to top it off too
like a really thin one
with sparkly tassels
well that's less harlot and more tramp
What the fuck
dude says you
Says me What?
"What the fuck"
No that's what me says
What you says is basically NeGlIgIbLe
mOtHeRfUcKeR
Does this seem needlessly sarcastic to You?
hahhahahaha
Jesus Christ already
I'm playing Vampyr again
dude
you can't just do that
Assassins Creed Oddessy
hey
i didn't play that at all today
because i was working on my bot
for you
Read my DND sign asshole
definitely run out of ideas
Ideas are hard
they spent about 3 months only releasing videos about serial killers
at least that was interesting
i don't really care about hypothetical fantasy scenarios
Clearly
Hey, maybe next they'll do one about dragons
god i hope not
Dude you play Assassin's Creed, how can you not care about hypothetical fantasy
that's historical
it's different
No it's not
It's the same but in the past
yeah but you get to run around a cool place
Because no other game ever lets you explore interesting areas
you can't deny that ubisoft makes some of the best maps
I could totally do that
I would say their maps are average
Oh if Jack could here you now
He'd shit
which studio has better maps then
Square enix
what do they make
final fantasy?
Yep
never played that
No shit
hey it's not unheard of for me to play videogames
so what makes ff maps good
Expansive, realistic yet also fantastical and unique
Course they only make a final fantasy every 5 years
i thought final fantasy was a manga weeb cartoon anime game
That's because you judge everything from one experience
oh yeah i forgot
what's it actually like then
sell it to me
wait
are there dragons
Well there's a lot of them
Games that is
Final fantasy ones
And they're all reasonably different
yes i understand your goat
The most recent one is about an empire invading a royal capital
You play as the prince, who escaped the attack with the help of 3 retainers
And you basically go on a big road trip
you get help from dental implements?
Around a mock America
Killing robots
interesting
what are the graphics like
And eating a bunch of nice looking food
Oh pretty damn good on pc
It's got a lot of side quests
Like a LOT
Lots of people wearing black in it too
just watched the trailer for the windows edition
Yeah I bet you did
graphics wise, looks like gta4 with much much better lighting
It's a lot better than that
Hey I'll send you a clip of the ps4 graphics if you want
and when i wasn't being blinded by all the flashy magic spells that look incredibly daunting to get the hang of, the open world looked very expansive
i might get it just out of curiosity
are there dragons
Oh the spells are one button
And no
ok good
There are giant birds
that's fine
And even gianter tortoises
yum
There's big chickens
are there any little animals
There's big snakes
No
Not a one
so all the big animals are just normal sized compared to each other
so maybe the people are just small
Maybe
I just drank like a lot of sugar and now the evenings fucked
Seems so
What do you do to try and get to sleep
Not much
Fucking evidently
Ikr
Isaac I have a 9 am start tomorrow
Fucking do something
Dude Idk, I just wait
I'll just do more sugar
That's the opposite of good
I don't consider you an authority on sleeping
Do you consider me an authority on not sleeping?
Uhh
No
Mostly I think you're an authority on isaac
Well
Isaac finds it easier to stay awake with sugar
That might have to do at this point
I watch streams while lying down in bed until I feel like closing my eyes
Then eventually I realise the stream is keeping me awake and turn it off
And go to sleep
Usually takes longer and longer every night
So yesterday
I submit a case to Lenovo about sending a laptop in for repair under warranty
And they sent me an email telling me what the conditions were for what time UPS would be collecting it
Which said if you make the request before 15:30 They would collect next day
Business day
Then it said if you make the request after 15:30 they would collect it in two business days
Since I made the request at about 16:45 That gave me loads of time to find something to put the laptop in and label it up
Since they wouldn't be collecting it today
Nope
Come in today and get a call from reception saying they've already tried to collect it at like 8:30
So now I've rushed to get it packaged up and they're coming back most likely on Monday
Really fucking annoying
!markov
Ahh see if you worked at tesco everything is comfortably late
You fucking fan boy
And stop abusing vault boy
True though
People just like complaining
Especially about shitty things
I started watching Informer
Looks alright
You should watch it
Stop complaining you twat
I mean the first episode only really sets up the series
So I'm not entirely sure what it's about yet
But I'm interested to find out
Is it on netflix
Iplayer
What the fuck
Look at this motherfucker with 4 middle fingers
I've fucking seen it Jamie and it made me feel sick the last time round
Dude
It's fucking awesome
I want 12 fingers
Yeaaah imagine what you could achieve then
I could play 12 notes on the piano at the same time
I could play a Bmajmin7/F# on the guitar
Audio from Thomas Bradley
I plugged headphones into my phone for that
Hold on you can access that shit?
Never heard of an opus file but yes
It's my opus magnum
What's that
My life's work
Yeah so is mine
I fucking slept through my 10 am start
Fuck
Might have had something to do with you being up at fucking 4am
Oh yeah and who's fault was that dickhead
I think we both know the answer to that
Maybe you'd like to elaborate
Do I really need to
I think we're both thinking the same thing here
Go on, prove to me how responsible and mature you are
I once hit my sister over the head with a trowel
Your turn
I gave me brother a seizure?
Right well I'm glad we cleared that up
Fuck me dude that next package apparently never got cancelled
I've just sent my dad some liengerie
Wow are they just sending it again?
That's nice of them
I didn't get a refund
Is this the seizure one?
No
You ass
Tfw ur watching a tv show and there's someone sitting in the exact same model of off brand Ikea style chair
Holland just slept through a fire drill
The whole state of Holland?
That was some shit
And stood out in the wet grass in my sicks because they wanted to see if the fire alarms still worked after having tested them two days ago
SOCKS
I SAID SOCKS
Wow dock move
My nice boss (as opposed to businessman boss and ex marine boss) just came in with a bunch of stuff from a bakery for us
I got a caramel donut
Man that was filling
That's a new one
depends on the porn
I mean, you may as well listen to smooth jazz at that point
At least smooth jazz flows properly
I would argue certain porn flows like fuck
I'm slightly too proud of that sentence
Ok what porns that then
dude idk
I'm not gonna give you a goddamn list
:(
What's a good name for a fish
Hucklesberry
Really?
Why
Because of the famous old american literature character Huckleberry Finn
duh
Oh right yes very clever
on par with Tom Sawyer
although that might just pip it
not for fish names
for fame
and oldness
tbf the only reason I know who those two are is because of comics
Yeah I've only heard of huckleberry finn
And tom sawyer sounds like a joke name
Like Robin banks
Ivor bignose
Lydia dustbin
great
thanks for that
Laura norder
I know a real person called Benedict Brain
Wow
That's an amazing name
I hope he grows up as a hero not a villain
Has he ever been referred to as Mr. B. Brain
or maybe he's the uncle
B.T. Brain
What's the T
Timothy
Because I was implying the B could stand for big
Mr. Big Thucking Brain
right
Sorry
Wait why did I apologise then
I retract my unsubstantiated and unnecessary apology
Sorry for that
good good
!markov
!markov
Great

Wow, whoever wrote that example sounds like a prick
!news
Are you seeing the image?
I'm not
The image adds so much
Usually
!news
So I think I've been shadowbanned from halls
that's what you get for wearing lingerie around campus
Excuse me?
it was a funny joke
although I guess that's subjective
more importantly
I just had a fuckin chinese sunday lunch
I am gonna be doin one hell of a shit tonight
I ate some shit with Jack
He says he's going to introduce me to his mental friend Trevor
Apparently he's really mental
If you wish
Oh fuck
Wrong chat
That's mental
whats shadowbanning in real life
all i know is it's when the reddit admins make all your posts invisible
they give you a hijab and pretend they can't see you
can they see the hijab
it's symbolic
also wtf
why wouldn't they
even in the hypothetical situation
i don't see hijabs
i see people for who they are
but hijabs are stupid
so hijabs are literally invisible to you?
yep i literally can't see them
in a manner of speaking
no my card no longer unlocks either security door
nice

Dude the pre-order of Fallout 76 I spent a couple hundred quid has given me an invalid beta access code
I can't get the predownload for the beta
for pc?
weird
Hahahaha
ON THIS POTATO!?
lol
Nah on xbone
on what then
do you have one
Not with me, I got it for Jo basically
Gonna try to play it with him over Christmas
Demands already talking about buying another copy since it's online only
DAD
I SAID DAD
But basically Bethesda has my debit card by the fucking nuts rn
the beta doesn't start until 23rd
https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-beta-release-date-how-to-get-access-eve/1100-6462394/
I know, but there's a predownload
Just so it's ready to go
I know that sounds retarded but it's a big game
no I've done it before
I've been hyping Jo up this whole time as well
There has to be a climax or I'm fucked
tom have you really never heard of a preload
that site explains it better as well
it's not just that the beta hasn't started yet
No I haven't
I've only ever pre ordered two games and the other one didn't do any of this shit
I had it for ESO
Nor was it worth the 70 quid I spent on it
the last online only bethesda game
Hahaha no it wasn't
what was then
Uhh
Surviving mars
Published by paradox so you know lips were ready
was it made by bethesda?
I don't think so lol
They went for a 60s/futuristic aesthetic
Works pretty well but it's a pretty simple game
Kinda similar to darkest dungeon in that regard
I'd make a good IGN TBH
Sonic is shit but oh man what a classic
Anyway sonic is bad, but I didn't finish it so don't take my word for it
Tired concept
7.8926/10.3
sonic is hard
well old sonic is
Designed to keep you feeding it those quarters
I was so angry when I replayed Alex Kidd on the classics release
I always wanted to know how it ended
They might as well have shat on my face
man you should play megaman
definition of quarter fodder
!define quarter fodder
oh right
usually used in the phrase cannon fodder
and pretty much nothing else
hahaha i just realised that harass has ass in it
also fodder is the plural
and the singular
just realised that example is wrong
i understand
it's ok
!quote
I just refilled Alex
No
Nono
Redpilled
i still don't understand what you mean by redpill
Watch the fucking matrix jamie
are you kidding me
im not watching that shit
Also Holland can't run faster than the police haha
These guys are fucking cunts and I never want to speak to them again
Holland's a fucking province in The Netherlands
not a person
what about Holland and Barret
bet you that's a surname
I bet Tom is referring to that person by their surname
He literally demands we use his surname
hey Tom, did you watch that Final Space thing?
I dont think so
good
me neither
Huh
Is it shit?
well, my brother is watching the the final episode in front of me rn
it's really not good
I finished stranger thongs
Overrated
but not bad
No
But there was a LOT of hype
And the original buzz has worn off now
I just don't want them dragging it out like lost
yeah I think it's done
No the third season was officially confirmed before the second aired
There was so much hype
feelsbadman
Obviously I want more
I'd love another season's
But I don't have any self control
7 seasons fuck you
Daredevil's out
Ugh
Should have let him die
tbf he dies in the comics too
unike GoT
wow that was unspecific
Yeah I'm lost
there were characters that died in the series that didn't die in the books
they just had them die too because
I mean it shouldn't have to stay completely faithful to the books
yeah, it's just the reason why
I have to assume old George knew what direction he was taking the story
instead of just vying for audience reaction
Maybe
I'm really not into it enough to care
HEY DID YOU SEE GAME OF THRONES WOW DIDNT EXPECT CHARACTER X TO DIE IN SUCH A MORBID AND GRUESOME AND UNEXPECTED FASHION I SURE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE CHARACTER Y WHO DIED THIS EPISODE BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE STICKING IT OUT UNTIL NEXT EPISODE
sure
that
For fucks sake
WHAT AN ORIGINAL AND NOT UNORIGINAL CONCEPT
Just because your interests don't range outside of where they put what collectible in the super cool new AC map
YOU GUYS WANNA FUCK
I MEAN SEX
I MEAN TALK IN SEX
*gasp* maybe there will be more boats
*REEEEEE*
I use videogames to escape my reality
i UsE rEaLiTy To EsCaPe My vIdEoGaMeS
Nah you're too fringe for GoT
someone recommended it to me
at work
i was like
fuck offff
You're so fucking fringe you refuse to watch Rick and Morty on 'principle'
except i didn't say that because you know me
hey i watched one episode at my sister's demand
and i think i blew air out of my nose at at least one point
Which episode though
And yes I realise it's beneath you
uhh the one where they go to a different planet and time
Because your David Mitchell 2.0
Uh oh made a typo
Not gonna passive aggressively correct me are you
no, but why are you dnd?
because he went passagg on my rightful and honest dnd yesterday
Oh shit
Ooohhh
That explains why my phone wasn't getting notifications
hah
yeah I did the same thing
missed a whole paragraph
I didn't even realise it was a thing on discord
Jamie what do you like
Outside of AC
Like you hate so much
and tf2
female genitalia
Yikes
That's a yikes from me
idk can i say tf2
dude I already said no
damn i thought you'd forget
are we talking games here
because the witcher 3 is pretty cool
still haven't finished it
lul
but i don't really play that many games anymore
i haven't played tf2 since the end of august
and even then the past year when i've been playing it it's been one-offs
We're talking any media
well i like doctor who
For fucks sake
and i'm currently watching red dwarf
and informer
and i really liked killing eve
and bodyguard was alright
and pornhub
and that documentary about syria is good
still waiting on the third installment
next tuesday i think
I mean you're really nothing until you've taken the red pill
Not cultured in the slightest
the next film i'm gonna watch is The Wall with Bob Geldof in
and i don't know what to expect
or when i'm gonna watch it
watch The Matrix instead
no dude
no
That's a fucking corner stone of this society
that's exactly what the matrix would say
It's literally treason to have not watched it
i have watched it
i just don't remember most of it
it's very different
i remember the bit with the white guy and the black guy in the place with the white background
Doesn't scare you does it?
It being different
and the black guy has sunglasses that don't leave much to the imagination
i think that's all i remember
obviously i know of the leaning back thing
and the requiem for a dream music
but i think i can safely say i just imparted all my knowledge of the original matrix film
really feels like you only picked up very sparse knowledge
nothing at all of the plot in fact
considering there is nothing i know about the film that i haven't just told you, then that assessment is probably correct if it is based on what i have just told you
OH
there's also green computer text
I bet you didn't even know that from the movie
all the references and clips and me actually watching the movie one time over 10 years ago has all merged into one
so I couldn't honestly tell you
My toe is still twitching
Just to keep you boys up to date
my feet are cold
i have legs
I have no hair on my balls
RIP
I have nothing to watch and I must scream
watch informer
No
It's bad
watch the bbc2 doc on assad
watch fucking killing eve
Haha ass
you will not regret that
Watch preacher
Get Amazon Prime and watch preacher then sneaky Pete
yeah but watch killing eve first
Amazon prime kills puppies
Needs to be on netflix
killing eve is on iplayer
If Amazon Prime kills puppies then surely you can just ill stream them
Netflix > iplayer
I don't do that anymore
I've gone legit
You can call the cops man it don't mean shit
tom surely iplayer > netflix if it has something that netflix doesn't have AND it's free
Yeah but if you morally disagree with Amazon
What?
Than it's morally right to boycott it
tv license is related to address not dormatory
you don't own the property so it's not your FACKING problem
I don't even know what you're saying
me tooeither
You guys are no help at all
watch killing eve
Watch life on Mars
Netflix
It's just not though
they took it off
that's irritating
i have an idea
watch killing eve
Unabomber
that's on netflix
and there's that series about psychopaths that was good
isaac you should watch killing eve
maybe I will
seems like a lot of effort though
not watching it on iplayer
the series itself
just watch the first episode
is there any humour in it
besides the crazy chick
yes
dark humour
well that seems
like it wouldn't be easy to watch
don't get me wrong
it's probably good
i found it pretty easy
fair enough
you should watch Hannibal
not sure what that's on
i don't have netflix
i will have amazon prime commencing around the 3rd of november
well I don't know what it's on anyway
but you should watch sneaky pete
and preacher, but I feel like you'll prefer sneaky pete
when you get amazon prime
I think Hannibal is on amazon prime too
so that
what's hannibal and sneaky pete and preacher about
i just had a whole haribo starmix
the big one tm
my teeth no longer exist
dude I have to try and *not* do that
it's natural to eat the whole bag for me
anyway
Hannibal is about a psychological profiler working with local police and two other psychologists to try and catch a brutal serial killer
me too
you know who Hannibal is right?
oh so not the cannibal
yeah you do
only by name
it pretty much explains itself after that
it's very good
and bloody
ok
Sneaky Pete is about a con-man, just released from prison, pretending to be his cellmate in order to get money out of the cellmate's family, and therefore pay his brother's bail from a crime boss
it's aight
Bryan Cranston's in it
Preacher is about a preacher in a small american town dealing with asshole locals, and his diminishing faith. It's pretty hard to explain much more without ruining anything
but it gets pretty wild
and bloody
nice rainbow keyboard fag
tom
word of warning
if you're planning on getting a gaming laptop
the battery life is usually awful
ew mechanical keyboard on a gaming laptop
also if you're getting a mechanical keyboard for the clicky sound you're coming at it from the wrong angle
I'm hungry, and all I have in the house is soup
the point is it makes typing faster and less effort because you don't have to press the key all the way down
eat some fucking soup then
but I have no *bread*
so use your hands
it's not like anywhere in this fucking village is open past 11
Jesus I hate soup without bread for lunch
I was so fucking miserable
also who the fuck uses the laptop keyboard when using a laptop
especially on a gaming laptop
Hype hype hype
you'd most likely get an external keyboard
why would you bother
They were like this with every aspect
i think mine was about £70
who's they btw
Oh wow that's cheap
That's so very cheap
yeah
yeah and it has brown switches
the best
unless you mean the keyboard
in which case
the opposite
because they give you the clicky feel without the annoying sound
He's a guy I meant during the fresher fair, I told him I was looking to buy a new laptop and he practically jizzed himself
hah
And Jamie no disrespect but your keyboard is cancerous
rip
hey my keyboard is holy
anyway
tell him you want a laptop with integrated graphics and at most 4gb ram
and a 2ghz processor
i hear those are real snazzy
and make sure it has fucking rubber dome keys
that sounds awful
that's just mine
you know why?
yeah
I do
because
it IS mine
Oh good someone else to give me advice on what laptop to get
don't fucking buy a gaming laptop
that's why
I was running scarce on them
hah
you have every console under the sun what do you need a gaming laptop for
I have a ps3
a gaming laptop is like a porsche
yeah that's all he has
That's one console
Jamie I've moved out
And even in adderbury I didn't own or use any of those consoles
it's a "sports car" for cheap
And at most I'm looking to spend a grand
Which is convenient because that's what I haven't paid to live here
you're looking to spend a grand?!
don't waste it on a goddamn laptop then
Let's hear your thoughts Jamie
because if your idea is to also use it for studying good luck when you take it to the lecture and dont have anywhere to plug it in
those things have battery life of like 2-3 hours
dude that's like how much mine has
because there's a fucking beefy graphics card in there sucking up all the power
why is this thing so bad
isaac you know the answer
the answer is get a new one
this one does the job
so far
then what are you complaining about
everyone seems to be saying it's the worst
Stone Cold Juggaloheute um 00:11 Uhr
why is this thing so bad
I don't take my laptop to lectures like some hip fag
Oh look at me cross examining my notes and the lecturers notes
Fuck off
I already know everything they're preaching anyway
My being here is a formality
But you're right I'll so regret that low battery life when I leave it plugged in until next September
it's your call
if you're not gonna move it in all that time
why not save some money and buy some desktop pc parts
Because I need the mobility you dick
ok but if you get one of those monstrosities you will not be able to move it around
it will die on you
this game is fun
what is it
apart from i know the name
heat signature
but what is heat signature
it's like a space heist game
somewhat randomly generated
with a bunch of weird gadgets
the main fun of the game being learning how to pull off ridiculously difficult heists
and building up a character with cool items
you also slowly take over the galaxy
but that kinda just seems like a side note
although I guess that could be considered an end goal
because otherwise there's not much driving it
sounds like a game
sorry i can't keep my eyes open
i have to sleep
goodnight
What?
you wouldn't understand
you're not woke
that's liam gallagher of oasis fame ripping on radiohead as usual
I'm not woke?
I'm actually looking forward to black mirror season 5 your blue pill bitch
hah

i can't make it any faster without making the responses lower quality
and i was trying to get it to say it was typing so we knew it was actually doing something
but it's being stupid so this will have to do
